<a href="http://kinow.deviantart.com/gallery/">--&raquo; Portfolio &laquo;--</a>

Drawing <a href="http://kinow.deviantart.com/gallery/">comics, logos and illustrations</a>
is my hobby (as well as trying to surf, slack line, judo, and play bodhran). If you have
any question, or would like to use my work, just [drop me a message]({{ site.root }}contact).

I am specially interested in: academic works (papers, thesis), books and chapters, articles
(in special on semantic, logic, linguistics, life sciences), presentations, and web in general.

I keep my portfolio at [DeviantArt](http://kinow.deviantart.com/gallery/), so head over
there if you would like to take a look some of my work.

You can reach me at [@kinow](http://twitter.com/kinow), or catch up with me near 
Paulista Avenue, in Sao Paulo city. Look for me in bookstores, walking on the 
streets or in the nearby pubs.

## New projects

I'm always open for new projects. Don't be shy. Are you in Sao Paulo? My local is 
[O'Malleys](http://omalleysbar.net) pub, near Paulista Avenue. 
If you ever stumble with me round there, I would be delighted to hear more 
about your ideas.

## Illustrations

Drawing, comics, logos and illustrations are my hobby (as well as trying to surf, slack 
line or play bodhran). If you have any question, or would like to use my work, just 
drop me a message.

## Bioinformatics

I have special interest in universities, companies, researchers or programmers involved 
with computational bioinformatics. I have an Open Source project that integrates 
several bioinformatics tools using Jenkins and continuous integration techniques. If you 
have any interest on this, plase feel free to drop me a message at any time, or 
check out [the project webpage](http://www.biouno.org).

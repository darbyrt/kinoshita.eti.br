You can reach me at [@kinow](http://twitter.com/kinow), or catch up with me near 
Queen Street, in Auckland city. Look for me in bookstores, walking on the 
K'Road, or in the nearby pubs.

## New projects

I'm always open for new projects. Don't be shy. Are you in Auckland? My local is 
the [Shakespeare](http://www.shakespearehotel.co.nz/) brewery, on Albert Street. 
If you ever stumble with me round there, I would be delighted to hear more 
about your ideas.

## Illustrations

Drawing <a href="http://kinow.deviantart.com/gallery/">comics, logos and illustrations</a>
is my hobby (as well as trying to surf, slack line, judo, and play bodhran). If you have
any question, or would like to use my work, just drop me a message.

## Bioinformatics

I have special interest in universities, companies, researchers or programmers involved 
with computational bioinformatics. I have an Open Source project that integrates 
several bioinformatics tools using Jenkins and continuous integration techniques. If you 
have any interest on this, plase feel free to drop me a message at any time, or 
check out [the project webpage](http://www.biouno.org).

Hey there!

I'm **Bruno P. Kinoshita**, born in 84 in **Sao Paulo city**, Sao Paulo, **Brazil**. 
I'm a typical Paulistano, and just love this city!

<div style="float: right"><img src="{{ assets.showing }}" title="Bruno P. Kinoshita" /></div>

I started having fun with computers back in 98, and got my first job with computers years later working for a 
mobile carrier, in the VAS team. Back then I was a **Java developer**, but so far I've worked as 
*Software Quality Engineer* for about two years too, *Infrastructure Engineer* for about the same time, 
and lately I've been doing *DevOps* and *Data Analysis* projects.

Although I've had to wear different hats (even had my moment with *bioinformatics :), 
I've always programmed in [Python]({{pctagurl('python')}}), [Java]({{pctagurl('java')}}), 
[Perl]({{pctagurl('perl')}}), [R]({{pctagurl('r')}}), [C]({{pctagurl('c')}}) or some 
[other language]({{pctagurl('geek')}}). 
In 2012 I've received the honor to become part of [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org) as 
an **Apache Commons Committer**!

Now I'm co-founder of [TupiLabs](http://www.tupilabs.com), 
with Cesar Fernandes. 
A company focused in [innovative solutions]({{pccaturl('ideas')}}) and 
[Open Source]({{pctagurl('open source')}}) software.

Apart from computers, I also like playing my guitar, climbing, drawing, walking on 
the slack line, dancing, swimming, watching some movies and reading Janet Evanovich, 
Haruki Murakami and Charlaine Harris' books. While I'm programming I like listening to Celtic music.

I've already been to New Zealand, Argentina, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, 
South Africa and United States. And, as many Brazilians (99% of the population I guess), 
I'm mixed race. My dad's parents are from Kumamoto, Japan, and my mom's parents are half 
Brazilian natives and half French (I think).

Feel free to get in touch through my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kinow) 
or [GitHub](http://github.com/kinow) accounts. For further information, 
you can also check my complete [CV]({{site.base_url}}cv.pdf).

That's all folks! Valeu!

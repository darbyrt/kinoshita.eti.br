<p>When I was younger and was studying at <a href="http://www.cnsd-sp.com.br/">CNSD</a>,
my father always gave me money for the book fair - though he never gave me money to buy lunch at
school (had to bring something from home) or for video games. Then when I got older, he would
take me to bookshops and tell me that I could choose anything. I remember when I hesitantly got
Peter Norvig's Artificial Intelligence from one of the shelves. It was over 300 BRL (lot of money
for a book in Brazil). He bought it without thinking, and told me that what I was learning with
the books would stay with me forever.</p>

<p>That's how I ended up with piles of books that I had to give away or sell when I moved to
New Zealand. This page contains a list that started with a database used to sell the books online.</p>

<p>Tables sorted by author name.</p>

</h2>

<p>Only wrote or helped with Open Source books. I helped on the build scripts for the
<a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/posa/introduction.html">The Performance of Open Source
Applications</a> book, but my contribution was minimal comparing to the authors and other
people involved in the build process (in special Tavish Armstrong!).</p>

</h2>

<p>Normally I read one of two fiction books, and one technical. I try to always carry the fiction
books, and sometimes manage to read one in one weekend, but lately I have not had a lot of time
to read. And sometimes, even though I am reading a book, if you ask me which book I am reading,
I can tell you the story, but have no idea about the title.</p>

<p>ps: some technical books I read the digital book, but for the rest I need to touch/feel/smell
the paper, and preferably buy and stash it.</p>

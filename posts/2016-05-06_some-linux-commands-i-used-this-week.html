These are some commands I used on Linux servers this week. Adding them here in case someone else
find them interesting, and also due to my bad memory :-)

## Listing latest installed packages in SLES

{% geshi 'shell' %}
rpm -qa --last
{% endgeshi %}

This will display the last packages installed. Useful when there are packages being updated, and you
need to confirm what changed, and when.

## Listing packages in SLES and origin repository

{% geshi 'shell' %}
rpm -qa --qf '%-30{DISTRIBUTION} %{NAME}\n'| sort
{% endgeshi %}

The output will have two columns. The first containing the repository name, and the second column with
the package name. For example.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
devel:languages:R:base / SLE_11_SP2 R-base
devel:languages:R:base / SLE_11_SP2 R-base-devel
home:flacco:sles / SLE_11_SP3 php53-phar
home:happenpappen / SLE_11_SP2 nodejs
{% endgeshi %}

## Grep for content in XML tags

Be it for web services, or for finding things in Jenkins XML files. Being able to grep the tag attribute
or tag name might be useful. Look at the following example that uses the 
[books XML provided by Microsoft for testing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms762271%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).

{% geshi 'shell' %}
grep -oP "(?<=<genre>).*?(?=</genre>)" books.xml | sort | uniq
{% endgeshi %}

Which will outputs the following.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
Computer
Fantasy
Horror
Romance
Science Fiction
{% endgeshi %}

## Find Python site packages directory

Sometimes you have Anaconda, but also the system installation, and maybe even other Python distributions.
Knowing where Python is looking for site packages can be helpful to confirm the package exists, and also
to inspect its sources.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print(get_python_lib())"
{% endgeshi %}

An example of the output of the script.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
{% endgeshi %}

That's all for today.

Happy hacking!

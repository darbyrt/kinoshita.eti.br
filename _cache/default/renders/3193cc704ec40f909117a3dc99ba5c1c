{"segments": {"content": "<p>Today I talked to two QA Engineers about code coverage and we all agreed that code coverage helps, but is not enough. And by coincidence today I had to fix a bug in <a title=\"tap4j - Test Anything Protocol API for Java\" href=\"http://tap4j.sourceforge.net/\">tap4j</a> that reminded me the same thing. My <a title=\"Cobertura homepage\" href=\"http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/\">cobertura</a> (the coverage tool that I was using at moment) report said that my code was covered by my tests. However there was a <em>bug in the covered code</em>.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"tap4j Cobertura report\" href=\"http://tap4j.sourceforge.net/cobertura/index.html\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-525  aligncenter\" title=\"Cobertura code coverage\" src=\"/2011/01/25/code-coverage-helps-but-not-enough/coverage.jpg\" alt=\"Cobertura code coverage\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" /></a></p>\nIf you are curious about the code you can see this issue <a title=\"tap4j BUG #3165200\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=3165200&amp;group_id=351793&amp;atid=1470124\">here</a>.

This test protocol has been used by Perl developers since Perl&#8217;s first version (1983~) but hasn&#8217;t been used by many Java developers yet, unfortunately. We hope it incentives other Java developers to use TAP for their tests. There is an alternative to TAP too, <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/subunit\">SubUnit</a>, which was pointed out for me by <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~lifeless\">Robert Collins</a> in the <a href=\"http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html\">Jenkins dev-list</a> few weeks ago. Now I am preparing a comparison between TAP and SubUnit as an analysis before developing a plug-in for Jenkins to show detailed test results (such as exception, images, raw test, error line, etc). </p>\n<p>Throughout the article we explain how to use <a href=\"http://www.tap4j.org\">tap4j</a> to generate TAP Streams with <a href=\"http://www.testng.org\">TestNG</a>, however it is possible to use the same approach to generate TAP Streams with <a href=\"http://www.junit.org\">JUnit</a>.</p>\n<p>Now I will translate the article to send it to <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~patl/\">Patrick LeBoutillier</a>, who contributed to this article answering patiently my questions by mail and writing <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~patl/metatap-0.01/\">metatap</a>, a utility that lets you check if a TAP Stream is valid, according to the program parameters. This utility is being used in tap4j for integration tests between Perl and Java.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I&#8217;m not allowed to redistribute the article, not even an English version of it :-(</p>\n<p>Cheers :)</p>"}, "pass_info": {"used_taxonomy_terms": [], "used_pagination": false, "pagination_has_more": false, "used_assets": true, "used_source_names": []}}

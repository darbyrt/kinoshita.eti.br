{"segments": {"content": "<p>This morning I was setting up a <a href=\"http://graphite.wikidot.com/\" title=\"Graphite\">Graphite </a>server to collect metrics with <a href=\"https://github.com/etsy/statsd/\" title=\"statsd\">statsd</a>, <a href=\"http://logstash.net/\" title=\"LogStash\">LogStash </a>and <a href=\"https://github.com/jmxtrans/jmxtrans\" title=\"jmxtrans\">jmxtrans</a>. After following the instructions from @jgeurst, I&#8217;ve successfully installed Graphite.</p>\n\n<p>I had previously installed another test box, so I decided to take a deeper look at the settings, write a <a href=\"https://puppetlabs.com/\" title=\"Puppet\">puppet</a> manifest and prepare this new box to become a production server. However, after browsing the webapp, all graphs were broken.</p>\n\n<p>After googling a while, reading forums and bugs, I decided to open the <em>$GRAPHITE_HOME/webapp/graphite/render/views.py</em>, adding <em>log.rendering(&#8230;)</em> statements (not the most elegant solution, I know).</p>\n\n<p>By following the program workflow I found out it was entering a block after checking if it should remotely render the image. This feature is turned on/off by <strong>REMOTE_RENDERING</strong> = True/False, in local_settings.py.</p>\n\n<p>After setting this to <em>False</em> the problem was solved.</p>"}, "pass_info": {"used_taxonomy_terms": [], "used_pagination": false, "pagination_has_more": false, "used_assets": false, "used_source_names": []}}

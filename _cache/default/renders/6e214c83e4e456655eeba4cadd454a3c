It is a conference on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language\" title=\"Pattern Language\">pattern languages</a> of programming. About six months ago I saw a tweet by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emguerra\" title=\"Eduardo Guerra\">Eduardo Guerra</a> asking if anyone had some cases where certain patterns were applied. It was a big coincidence, since I was working on <a href=\"http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/functor/\" title=\"Apache Commons Functor\">Apache Commons Functor</a> and some <a href=\"http://www.jenkins-ci.org\" title=\"Jenkins-CI\">Jenkins plugins</a>, both projects with cases that could be used in his paper.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/\"><img src=\"/2012/09/25/paper-patterns-for-introducing-a-superclass-for-test-classes/sugarloaf2012_300_146.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"SugarLoaf Plop 2012\" width=\"300\" height=\"146\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1071\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>So I joined Guerra and gave my small contribution to the paper that <a href=\"http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/pages/acceptedpapers.html\" title=\"accepted papers\">has been accepted</a> for this edition of SugarLoafPlop. Guerra also went there to give a talk and participate in an open discussion about several papers, including ours.</p>\n\n<p>I simply love when these things happen, it was great work with Guerra, and even better for being able to use Open Source examples in our paper.</p>"}, "pass_info": {"used_taxonomy_terms": [], "used_pagination": false, "pagination_has_more": false, "used_assets": true, "used_source_names": []}}

Kinoshita</strong>, born in 84 in <strong>Sao Paulo city</strong>, Sao Paulo, <strong>Brazil</strong>. \nI&#8217;m a typical Paulistano, and just love this city!</p>\n<div style=\"float: right\"><img src=\"/about/showing.jpg\" title=\"Bruno P. Kinoshita\" /></div>\n\n<p>I started having fun with computers back in 98, and got my first job with computers years later working for a \nmobile carrier, in the VAS team. Back then I was a <strong>Java developer</strong>, but so far I&#8217;ve worked as \n<em>Software Quality Engineer</em> for about two years too, <em>Infrastructure Engineer</em> for about the same time, \nand lately I&#8217;ve been doing <em>DevOps</em> and <em>Data Analysis</em> projects.</p>\n<p>Although I&#8217;ve had to wear different hats (even had my moment with *bioinformatics :), \nI&#8217;ve always programmed in <a href=\"/tag/python\">Python</a>, <a href=\"/tag/java\">Java</a>, \n<a href=\"/tag/perl\">Perl</a>, <a href=\"/tag/r\">R</a>, <a href=\"/tag/c\">C</a> or some \n<a href=\"/tag/geek\">other language</a>. \nIn 2012 I&#8217;ve received the honor to become part of <a href=\"http://www.apache.org\">Apache Software Foundation</a> as \nan <strong>Apache Commons Committer</strong>!</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.tupilabs.com\">TupiLabs</a>, \nwith Cesar Fernandes. \nA company focused in <a href=\"/ideas\">innovative solutions</a> and \n<a href=\"/tag/open%20source\">Open Source</a> software.</p>\n<p>Apart from computers, I also like playing my guitar, climbing, drawing, walking on \nthe slack line, dancing, swimming, watching some movies and reading Janet Evanovich, \nHaruki Murakami and Charlaine Harris&#8217; books. While I&#8217;m programming I like listening to Celtic music.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve already been to New Zealand, Argentina, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, \nSouth Africa and United States. And, as many Brazilians (99% of the population I guess), \nI&#8217;m mixed race. My dad&#8217;s parents are from Kumamoto, Japan, and my mom&#8217;s parents are half \nBrazilian natives and half French (I think).</p>\n<p>Feel free to get in touch through my <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kinow\">Twitter</a> \nor <a href=\"http://github.com/kinow\">GitHub</a> accounts.

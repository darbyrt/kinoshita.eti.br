Kinoshita**, born in 84 in **Sao Paulo city**, Sao Paulo, **Brazil**. \nI'm a typical Paulistano, and just love this city!\n\n<div style=\"float: right\"><img src=\"{{ assets.showing }}\" title=\"Bruno P. Kinoshita\" /></div>\n\nI started having fun with computers back in 98, and got my first job with computers years later working for a \nmobile carrier, in the VAS team. Back then I was a **Java developer**, but so far I've worked as \n*Software Quality Engineer* for about two years too, *Infrastructure Engineer* for about the same time, \nand lately I've been doing *DevOps* and *Data Analysis* projects.\n\nAlthough I've had to wear different hats (even had my moment with *bioinformatics :), \nI've always programmed in [Python]({{pctagurl('python')}}), [Java]({{pctagurl('java')}}), \n[Perl]({{pctagurl('perl')}}), [R]({{pctagurl('r')}}), [C]({{pctagurl('c')}}) or some \n[other language]({{pctagurl('geek')}}). \nIn 2012 I've received the honor to become part of [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org) as \nan **Apache Commons Committer**!\n\nNow I'm co-founder of [TupiLabs](http://www.tupilabs.com), \nwith Cesar Fernandes. \nA company focused in [innovative solutions]({{pccaturl('ideas')}}) and \n[Open Source]({{pctagurl('open source')}}) software.\n\nApart from computers, I also like playing my guitar, climbing, drawing, walking on \nthe slack line, dancing, swimming, watching some movies and reading Janet Evanovich, \nHaruki Murakami and Charlaine Harris' books. While I'm programming I like listening to Celtic music.\n\nI've already been to New Zealand, Argentina, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, \nSouth Africa and United States. And, as many Brazilians (99% of the population I guess), \nI'm mixed race. My dad's parents are from Kumamoto, Japan, and my mom's parents are half \nBrazilian natives and half French (I think).\n\nFeel free to get in touch through my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kinow) \nor [GitHub](http://github.com/kinow) accounts. For further information, \nyou can also check my complete [CV]({{site.base_url}}cv.pdf).\n\nThat's all folks!

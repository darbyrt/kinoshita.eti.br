It is composed by a set of principles:\n\n* Collaborative software development\n* Commercial-friendly standard license\n* Consistently high quality software\n* **Respectful, honest, technical-based interaction**\n* Faithful implementation of standards\n* Security as a mandatory feature\n\nI have been part of [Apache Commons](http://commons.apache.org) for a while, and haven't \nreally contributed much yet. Maybe because I had lots of projects related to \n[TupiLabs](http://tupilabs.com) as well as my own wedding this year. But I can \nassure that *respectful, honest, technical-based interaction* is quite right (not to discredit the \nother items, of course).\n\nEven though there are critics of the Apache Way ([1]({{pcposturl(2013, 9, 29, \"the-apache-way-and-on-writing-software-reviews#1\")}}), [2]({{pcposturl(2013, 9, 29, \"the-apache-way-and-on-writing-software-reviews#2\")}}), [3]({{pcposturl(2013, 9, 29, \"the-apache-way-and-on-writing-software-reviews#3\")}})), it still stands as an important \npillar for the Apache Software Foundation, and its principles help to create stable and \nproduction ready software, such as [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org), \n[Apache Httpd](http://httpd.apache.org), [Apache Commons Lang](http://commons.apache.org/lang), \namong [others](http://projects.apache.org).\n\nThere are many reviews and comparisons on Apache software (as well as on \nother software, like JavaScript libraries, Java Web Frameworks, Ruby Web servers and so on). \nSometimes, though, these reviews or comparisons can be biased or not well founded. In \ncases like this, the developers of the tools may be frustrated, or users can be \nmisled and choose the software based on wrong assertions.\n\nI have just returned from honey moon, ready to start writing code again, but \nfirst I had to read all the unread messages in my inbox. Some were e-mails from [Apache \nmailing lists](https://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html). [One of these e-mails](http://markmail.org/thread/uoh5m55mh4qjybaw) \nhad Phil Steitz comments on a post by Daniel Wu. \n\nInstead of publishing his performance benchmark results of \n[Apache Commons Pool](http://commons.apache.org/pool), Daniel posted his \ncode to the commons-dev mailing list. Phil Steitz, one of Apache Commons Pool \ncommitters replied with questions and a few points that Daniel could use to \nenrich his bechmark tests.\n\nThis kind of behavior happens a lot within Apache (at least in the mailing lists that \nI follow), and it produces a lot of benefits for different parts. \n\n* The person writing a review or comparison can get the programmer opinion before actually \npublishing anything. \n* The programmer can see how other people were testing his/her code.\n* All other commons-pool committers and maintainers, the mailing list readers, and \npeople that found the mailing list archives will be able to read the conversation \nhistory.\n* No misguided benchmark results were published (and lots of wrong decisions were avoided).\n\nI keep loving the Apache Way and the resulting community and code around it. There are \nalways lots of things to learn, the Open Source projects communities are healthy and you will always find \npeople willing to share their experience and time teaching you.\n\n\u2665 Open Source\n\n * * *\n\n<sup><a name=\"1\">1</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/has-apache-lost-its-way-225267?page=0,2\">\nhttp://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/has-apache-lost-its-way-225267?page=0,2</a></sup>\n\n<sup><a name=\"2\">2</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.futurealoof.com/posts/apache-considered-harmful.html\">\nhttp://www.futurealoof.com/posts/apache-considered-harmful.html</a></sup>\n\n<sup><a name=\"3\">3</a> \n<a href=\"http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/227477/has-open-source-outgrown-apache-way\">\nhttp://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/227477/has-open-source-outgrown-apache-way</a></sup>", "o": 151, "f": null}]}}

Basically, I look at the \nfeatures, documentation, community, open issues (in special blockers or criticals), the time \nto release fixes and new features and, obviously, the license.\n\nAt the moment I'm using [Apache Jena](http://jena.apache.org) to work with ontologies, SPARQL \nand data matching and enrichment for a customer. \n\nJena is fantastic, and similar tools include [Virtuoso](http://www.w3.org/wiki/VirtuosoUniversalServer), \n[StarDog](http://stardog.com/), [GraphDB](http://www.ontotext.com/products/ontotext-graphdb-owlim/), \n[4Store](http://4store.org/) and others. From looking at the code and its community and documentation, \nJena seems like a great choice. \n\nI'm still investigating if/how we gonna need to use inference and reasoners, looking \nat the issues, and learning my way through its code base. The following is my initial mapping \nof what happens when you submit a SPARQL query to Fuseki.\n\n<div class='row'>\n<div class=\"span6 offset3\" style='text-align: center;'>\n<figure>\n<a href=\"{{assets.drawing1}}\" rel=\"prettyPhoto\" class=\"thumbnail\" title=\"Fuseki SPARQL query work flow\">\n<img src=\"{{assets.drawing1}}\" alt=\"Fuseki SPARQL query work flow\" />\n</a>\n<figcaption>Jena JDBC</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nMy understanding is that Fuseki is just a web layer, handling a bunch of validations, logging, \nerror handling, and relying on the ARQ module, that is who actually handles the requests. \nI also think a new Fuseki server is baking in the project git repo, so stay tuned for an \nupdated version of this graph soon.\n\nHappy hacking!\n", "o": 139, "f": null}]}}

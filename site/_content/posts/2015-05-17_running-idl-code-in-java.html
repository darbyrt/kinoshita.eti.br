***TL;DR** when using a Demo license (or a node-locked license I believe) you can call only one IDL program at
a time. Otherwise you will get a JIDLBusyException.*

[IDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_%28programming_language%29), or Interactive Data Language, "is a
programming language used for data analysis". I had never heard about IDL until a few days ago, when
I had to review an issue at work that involved a Java Web program running some IDL code.

I decided to run IDL at home, using the Demo version from [Exelis](http://www.exelisvis.com/productsservices/idl.aspx) and
investigate what would happen if I made multiple simultaneous calls using a single license
(note: I'm using the Demo license, but there are
[other licensing options](http://licensing.exelisvis.com/licensehelp.aspx) that give you more flexibility). 
Furthermore, when running an IDL program using the Java bridge, you set a "process name". 
I also wanted to confirm that changing the process name wouldn't make any difference.

You can read the test source code below. The only IDL statement is `WAIT, 4`. It sleeps the program
for four seconds, before exiting. This way we have a program using the Demo license for 4 seconds, and
we can try using the license simultaneously.

{% geshi 'java' %}
package br.eti.kinoshita.idl;

import com.idl.javaidl.JIDLBusyException;
import com.idl.javaidl.JIDLObject;
import com.idl.javaidl.JIDLObjectI;
import com.idl.javaidl.JIDLOutputListener;
import com.idl.javaidl.java_IDL_connect;

public class SleepsTenSecondsHelloWorld implements Runnable, JIDLOutputListener {

    public void run() {
        final String tName = Thread.currentThread().getName();
        try {
            JIDLObject idlWrapper = new java_IDL_connect();
            idlWrapper.createObject();
            idlWrapper.addIDLOutputListener(this);
            idlWrapper.setProcessName("process01");
            idlWrapper.executeString("WAIT, 4");
            System.out.println(String.format("THREAD %s SUCCEEDED!", tName));
        } catch (JIDLBusyException jbe) {
            System.out.println(String.format("THREAD %s FAILED WITH ERR: %s", tName, jbe.getMessage()));
        }
    }

    public void IDLoutput(JIDLObjectI paramJIDLObjectI, String paramString) {
        System.out.println(paramString);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Runnable r = new SleepsTenSecondsHelloWorld();
        Thread t = new Thread(r);
        t.start();
    }
    
}
{% endgeshi %}

Turns out running IDL with Java is not so trivial, so the rest of the post will walk you through the problems
I've had while trying to do so, before actually testing the code. 
Hopefully it will be useful for others trying a similar approach. I'm using
Oracle Java 8, Ubuntu 14.04, Eclipse + Maven, in a quad-core and 6GB notebook.

##Troubleshooting IDL and Java errors

The first thing you need in order to be able to write a program that calls IDL in Eclipse is
import the JAR file that contains the IDL Java bridge API. This file is called
`javaidlb.jar`. You can search for it after you install Exelis' IDL.

Trying to run your program, the first error you will probably get is the following one:

{% geshi 'shell' %}
Failed to load javaidlb from  from default location.
Exception in thread "Thread-0" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: com.idl.javaidl.JIDLPAL.nativeInitJPAL()V

    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
{% endgeshi %}

Before trying to fix anything, there is a special and very useful setting that enables Debugging
the Java IDL bridge program initialization: **`-DIDL_LOAD_DEBUG`**. Set it as a VM argument in your IDE
to see extra debug information.

Reading the exception and the error messages, you will probably notice that it looks
like the Java program calls some native method but is not able to find a native library for it. 
Time to initialize the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable in your IDE too, to something like 
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/kinow/exelis/idl/bin/bin.linux.x86_64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. After doing so, 
try running your program again, and you'll see the `libhavaidlb.so` library being loaded too.

Good. Now the error message seems to be telling us that it cannot find some program in the IDL bin directory. 
You can find the exact library that contains this message by running 
`for x in `ls -f`; do strings $x | grep "Verify that" && echo "-- > Found in $x" ; done` in
the directory added to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and further debug the issue using some *nix tools like 
`gdb`, `ltrace`, `strace`, `strings`, etc.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
OPS Initialization failed.  Verify that '%s' exists in the IDL bin directory.

{% endgeshi %}

But it is easier to just guess that the `idl_opserver` executable is not being found by the library in the system `PATH`. 
I didn't find anywhere in the documentation mentioning that the IDL executables must be in the `PATH`, 
but thought it was worth a shot anyway.

Well, a different message now. If you read the whole documentation for bridges in IDL, you
will find somewhere that says that there are scripts in the IDL installation directory that
initialize environment settings for you in the command line. For Linux, you can search for `id_setup.bash` 
and `bridge_setup.bash`.

Looking at these scripts, you'll find out that they are setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and a few other
variables. After trying a couple of combinations, I've found out that setting the `IDL_DIR` variable fixes
this last error message. Et voil√†.

##Multiple calls with a single license

Time to test what happens when we make multiple calls to an IDL program while using a
Demo license. Let's start by changing the code to create a few more threads.

{% geshi 'java' %}
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Runnable r = new SleepsTenSecondsHelloWorld();
        Thread t = null;
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            t = new Thread(r);
            t.start();
        }
    }
{% endgeshi %}

Running the code, we confirm that we can call only one program at a time under the Demo
license - and probably it is the same with the node-locked license.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
Java location : /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/amd64 (set relative to java.home property)
Successfully loaded libawt.so
Successfully loaded libjawt.so
Successfully loaded libjavaidlb.so
THREAD Thread-1 FAILED WITH ERR: The object's associated IDL process is currently busy.
THREAD Thread-0 FAILED WITH ERR: The object's associated IDL process is currently busy.
THREAD Thread-2 SUCCEEDED!
{% endgeshi %}

One last change before giving up. Let's change the "process name", by simply appending the
current thread name.

{% geshi 'java' %}
        try {
            JIDLObject idlWrapper = new java_IDL_connect();
            idlWrapper.createObject();
            idlWrapper.addIDLOutputListener(this);
            idlWrapper.setProcessName("process01"+tName);
            idlWrapper.executeString("WAIT, 4");
            System.out.println(String.format("THREAD %s SUCCEEDED!", tName));
        } catch (JIDLBusyException jbe) {
            System.out.println(String.format("THREAD %s FAILED WITH ERR: %s", tName, jbe.getMessage()));
        }
{% endgeshi %}

And we can finally confirm that it doesn't make any difference.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
Java location : /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/amd64 (set relative to java.home property)
Successfully loaded libawt.so
Successfully loaded libjawt.so

THREAD Thread-2 FAILED WITH ERR: The object's associated IDL process is currently busy.
THREAD Thread-1 FAILED WITH ERR: The object's associated IDL process is currently busy.
THREAD Thread-0 SUCCEEDED!
{% endgeshi %}

So if you need to run some IDL code in a Web application, for example, you'll probably have to
consider the number of simultaneous users you will have, or you can try to enqueue user requests, 
process the IDL code in the background, and notify users when the response is ready.

The code for this post is hostead at [GitHub](https://github.com/kinow/idl-sandbox).

Happy hacking!

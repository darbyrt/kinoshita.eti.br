A spell checker can be defined as a software used to analyse text documents and compares words in these documents with dictionaries/wordlists of acceptable spellings.

I've been working on a [TupiLabs](http://www.tupilabs.com) project where I had 
to add a spell checker to a Java project. In this post I'll document what I've 
learned about spell checkers in Java.

A spell checker can be defined as a software used to analyse text documents and compares words in these documents with dictionaries/wordlists of acceptable spellings.

I've been working on a [TupiLabs](http://www.tupilabs.com) project where I had 
to add a spell checker to a Java project. In this post I'll document what I've 
learned about spell checkers in Java.

## Metrics

The following metrics were used in this comparison:

- Words suggestions
- Morphologic tagging
- License
- Provides an API
- Programming language

- Documentation
- Community
- Tests and overall code quality

## List of spell checkers

## Jazzy

Jazzy is not maintained anymore. I contacted the authors and they told me that 
at the moment they weren't working on a new version. However, someone released 
jazzy to Maven central repository. We have also forked jazzy at GitHub and 
released it under com.tupilabs repository.

Its dictionaries contain one word per line, and additional words can be included 
to this file, via the dictionary API. Since we have a new Portuguese ortography, 
updating the existing dictionaries will require a lot of time and regex's.

The code base is not so large, but has no use of generics, and could do with 
more tests. Parts of the spell checker and other classes have dependencies (imports) 
to Java Swing API.

## JOrtho

Its latest release was in March this year, but I couldn't find it in [Maven central 
repository](http://search.maven.org). 

What I liked the most in JOrtho, is that its dictionaries can be generated from 
Wikitionaries dumps. 

As in jazzy, parts of the spell checker API are mixed with Java Swing API. But the 
code has generics, few warnings and a consistent formatting. The SpellChecker 
class has several static properties, that are updated via static methods. This 
isn't thread-safe, and using the dictionary in a web container with multiple 
threads accessing its methods could cause lots of trouble.

There are few tests, but it doesn't look so hard to add new tests.

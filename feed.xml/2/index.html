    <title>Backward compatibility and switch statement with constant expressions</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 10, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/06/10/backward-compatibility-and-switch-statements-with-constant-expressions</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Maintaining Open Source software can be challenging. Making sure you keep backward compatibility (not only binary) can be even more challenging. <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/">Apache Commons Lang</a> 3.6 release is happening right now thanks to <a href="http://www.benediktritter.de/">Benedikt Ritter</a>, and it is on its fourth Release Candidate (i.e. RC4).</p>
<p>A previous RC2 was cancelled due to <a href="http://commons.markmail.org/thread/57sqt2hkusegda73#query:+page:1+mid:dnwo5tjqo2e5bwuo+state:results">IBM JDK 8 compatibility</a>, more specifically the lazy initialization of ArrayList&#8217;s seems to be different in Oracle JDK and IBM JDK.</p>
<p>The RC3 was cancelled due to a <a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/commit/18e692478dcf91fdceb9b9fdca7c61a1111d63aa">change</a> that could affect users using a switch statement.</p>
<p>The change was in the <em>CharEncoding</em> class. The issue was that this class has some constants, that stopped being <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.28">constant expressions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>A constant expression is an expression denoting a value of primitive type or a String that does not complete abruptly and is composed using only the following (&#8230;)</blockquote>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">CharEncoding</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">ISO_8859_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The code above contains a constant (<em>static final</em>) variable, that is a constant expression. So users can safely use it in switch statements, and the Java compiler won&#8217;t complain about it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">CharEncoding</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">ISO_8859_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StandardCharsets</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ISO_8859_1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">name</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The code above is from the change that caused the regression. Any user that was using the ISO_8859_1 constant variable in a switch statement would get a compilation error (e.g. <em>case expressions must be constant expressions</em>) when updating to Apache Commons Lang 3.6. That is because the constant variable is not a constant expression.</p>
<p>I think I learned that some time ago, but if you asked me what was wrong with the change, and if it would break backward compatibility, I would probably fail to spot the issue. There are tools for that now (e.g. Clirr, japicmp) though they may miss some cases too.</p>
<p>Luckily in this case a user subscribed to the Apache Commons development mailing list spotted the issue and quickly reported it. It gets easier maintaining an Open Source project with the constructive feedback of users, like this one.</p>

    <title>Securely using passwords with R</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 03, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/06/03/securely-using-passwords-with-r</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>It is quite common to have code that needs to interact with another system, database, or third party application, and need to use some sort of credentials to securely communicate.</p>
<p>Most of the code I wrote in <strong>R</strong>, or reviewed, had normally no borders (from a system analysis perspective) with other systems, or basically just interacted with the file system to retrieve NetCDF or JSON files.</p>
<p>However, after I saw a comment in <em>Reddit</em> [1] some time ago about this, I decided to check what others used. With <strong>R Shiny</strong> becoming more popular, and moving more R code to the web, I think this will become a common requirement for R code.</p>
<p>There is a blog post from <strong>RevolutionAnalytics</strong> [2] that does a nice summary of the options for that. The post is from 2015, but I do not think much changed now in 2017. From the blog post and comments, there are seven methods listed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/fishbaseapi/blob/80393023a958aee54e2daa58c337458db5480b84/config_template.yaml">credentials</a> in your source code</li>
<li>Put credentials in a file in your project, but do not share this file (<em>#3</em>, <em>#4</em>, and <em>#5</em> are similar to this one)</li>
<li>Put credentials in a <a href="https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/3-3-r-startup.html#rprofile">.Rprofile</a> file</li>
<li><strong>Put credentials in a <a href="https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/3-3-r-startup.html#renviron">.Renviron</a> file</strong></li>
<li>Put <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/fishbaseapi/blob/80393023a958aee54e2daa58c337458db5480b84/config_template.yaml">credentials</a> in a JSON or YAML file</li>
<li>Put credentials in a secure store that you can access from R</li>
<li>Ask the user for the credentials when the script is executed (possibly not useful for R Shiny applications)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My preferred way for R is the .Renviron (or a <a href="https://github.com/gaborcsardi/dotenv">dotEnv</a>) file</strong>. You basically store your password in this file, make sure you do not share this (a global gitignore could be helpful to prevent any accident) and read the variables when you start your code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">## Secrets</span>
MYSQL_PASSWORD<span class="o">=</span>secret
</pre></div>

<p>If you would like to increase the security, you can combine it with a variation of <em>#6</em>. You use a .Renviron file, and use an encryption service like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Amazon KMS</a> (KMS stands for Key Management Service).</p>
<p>With <a href="https://github.com/cardcorp/AWR.KMS">AWS KMS in R</a>, you can encrypt your values, put them encrypted in your .Renviron, and even if someone gets hold of your .Renviron file, you have an extra layer of protection, as the attacker would require access to your cloud environment to decrypt it too.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">## Secrets</span>
MYSQL_PASSWORD<span class="o">=</span>AQECAHga320J8WadplGCqqVAr4HNvDaFSQ<span class="o">+</span>NaiwIBhmm6qDSFwAAAGIwYAYJKoZIhvcNAQcGoFMwUQIBADBMBgkqhkiG9w0BBwEwHgYJYIZIAWUDBAEuMBEE99<span class="o">+</span>LoLdvYv8l41OhAAIBEIAfx49FFJCLeYrkfMfAw6XlnxP23MmDBdqP8dPp28OoAQ<span class="o">==</span>

    <title>Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 03, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/06/03/natural-language-processing-and-natural-language-understanding</link>

    <description><p>I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing"><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong></a> (NLP) tools in a few projects in the past years. But only recently, while involved with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot">chatbot</a> project, I noticed the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_understanding"><strong>Natural Language Understanding</strong></a> (NLU).</p>
<p>NLU can be seen as a subfield of NLP. NLP englobes all techniques used for parsing text and extracting some knowledge about it. It could be finding out what are the common entities in the text, calculating the likelihood of a certain word being a preposition or a verb, sentiment analysis, or even spell checking sentences.</p>

</div>

<p>When you are processing a language, it does not mean you are understanding the language. You may simply have rules, statistics, or some heuristics built to extract the information you need for some work.</p>
<p>NLU, on the other hand, implies that a system will try to understand the text. A text such as <em>&#8220;Given the price of mandarin lately, how likely is it to increase as much as the bananas?&#8221;</em>, could be parsed with NLP tools such as OpenNLP, CoreNLP, spaCy, etc.</p>
<p>However, you would have annotated text, entities, sentiment, perhaps coreference, but you still would not be able to build a machine that simply understands it. You can - with some effort - build rule based systems, apply semantics and ontologies, or use information retrieval techniques.</p>
<p>But it is still extremely hard to build a system to understand all the ways it could be said, slightly modified, such as <em>&#8220;are mandarins getting as expensive as bananas?&#8221;</em>, or take into consideration context information like localization or time <em>&#8220;were mandarins getting as expensive as bananas around the Pacific Islands five years ago?&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>There are other subfields in NLP, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation"><strong>Natural Language Generation</strong></a> (NLG). Techniques from both NLU and NLG are used in chat bots, to parse the language and also to generate text based on the conversation.</p>
<p>NLP is an extremely interesting topic. 2001: A Space Odissey, Star Trek, The Foundation Series, and other science fiction books and movies. These all have intelligente computer systems that interact with humans. But should we tried to re-create these right now, even with all the work on machine learning, we would still have very funny (and perhaps dangerous) results.</p>

    <title>Apache Commons Text LookupTranslator</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 02, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/06/02/apache-commons-text-lookuptranslator</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p><a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/">Apache Commons Text</a> includes several algorithms for text processing. Today&#8217;s post is about one of the classes available since the 1.0 release, the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/translate/LookupTranslator.html">LookupTranslator</a>.</p>
<p>It is used to translate text using a lookup table. Most users won&#8217;t necessarily be - knowingly - using this class. Most likely, they will use the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/StringEscapeUtils.html">StringEscapeUtils</a>, which contains methods to escape and unescape CSV, JSON, XML, Java, and EcmaScript.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">original</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;He didn&#39;t say, \&quot;stop!\&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;He didn&#39;t say, \\\&quot;stop!\\\&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">result</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StringEscapeUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">escapeJava</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">original</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>StringEscapeUtils uses CharSequenceTranslator&#8217;s, including LookupTranslator. You can use it directly too, to escape other data your text may contain, special characters not supported by some third party library or system, or even a simpler case.</p>
<p>In other words, you would be creating your own StringEscapeUtils. Let&#8217;s say you have some text where numbers must never start with the zero digital, due to some restriction in the way you use that data later.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Map</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">lookupTable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">HashMap</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;();</span>
<span class="n">lookupTable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">LookupTranslator</span> <span class="n">escapeNumber0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">LookupTranslator</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">[][]</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="s">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">});</span>
<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">escaped</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">escapeNumber0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">translate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;There are 02 texts waiting for analysis today...&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>That way the resulting text would be &#8220;There are 2 texts waiting for analysis today&#8221;, allowing you to proceed with the rest of your analysis. This is a very simple example, but hopefully you grokked how LookupTranslator works.</p>

    <description><p><a href="/2012/10/20/replacing-a-hashset-with-a-bitset">In 2012, I wrote</a> about how you always learn something new by following the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html">Apache dev mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p>After about five years, I am still learning, and still getting impressed by the knowledge of other
developers. Days ago I was massaging some code in <a href="https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/237">a pull request</a>
and a developer suggested me to simplify my code.</p>
<p>The suggestion was to make a class a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html">Comparable type</a>
to both simplify the code, and also have a better design. I immediately agreed, and looking back in hindsight,
it was the most logical choice. Yet, I simply did not think about that.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// What the code was</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">VSPACE_SORTKEY</span> <span class="o">:</span>

</pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// What the code is now</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">VSPACE_SORTKEY</span> <span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">((</span><span class="n">NodeValueSortKey</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">nv1</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">compareTo</span><span class="o">((</span><span class="n">NodeValueSortKey</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">nv2</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This moved the logic to a method in the <code>NodeValueSortKey</code> class. This reduced the complexity
of the class with the <code>switch</code> statement. And it also made it easier to write unit tests.</p>
<p>If you are not involved in Open Source projects yet, I keep my suggestion from five years ago.
Find a project related to something you like, and start reading the code, lurk in the
mailing list or watch GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>You can always learn more!</p>

    <description><p>This post is probably different from others. I will give a TL;DR, but will then
give you a copy of
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-42655?focusedCommentId=291470&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-291470">a comment of a Jenkins JIRA issue</a>.
Hope you have fun reading it,
specially if you maintain Jenkins servers or plug-ins.</p>
<p>TL;DR: there was an issue in Jenkins Job DSL Plug-in, that caused jobs created to
have an invalid script. The fix had not been released, but was already in the
master branch in GitHub.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #DDDDDD;">&diams;</p>

<p><em>Well, that was fun bug reproduced, I believe I know why that&#8217;s happening. Not so complicated to fix&#8230; but no fast way to fix it. Here&#8217;s the issue analysis (grab a coffee to read it).</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Downloaded jenkins.war (2.32.3.war)</em></li>
<li><em>mkdir /tmp/123</em></li>
<li><em>JENKINS_HOME=/tmp/123 java -jar jenkins.war</em></li>
<li><em>Entered secret into form and submitted</em></li>
<li><em>Installed suggested plugins (boy that takes a while)</em></li>
<li><em>Created temp user</em></li>
<li><em>Installed (without restart) active-choices-plugin 1.5.3</em></li>
<li><em>Installed (without restart) job-dsl-plugin</em></li>
<li><em>Manually stopped Jenkins, and started it again with same command #3</em></li>
<li><em>Log in with user, all looking good</em></li>
<li><em>Created Freestyle job JENKINS-42655 (see attached config.xml)</em></li>
<li><em>Executed job, and found new job JENKINS-42655-1</em></li>
<li><em>Never opened the job configuration, clicked on the &#8220;Generated Items link to JENKINS-42655-1&#8221; to open in a new tab</em></li>
<li><em>Clicked on Build with Parameters</em></li>
<li><em>Looked at logs, and noticed the security-script-plugin exceptions</em></li>
<li><em>Went to &#8220;Manage Jenkins&#8221; / &#8220;In-process Script Approval&#8221; and approved scripts</em></li>
<li><em>Went back to the JENKINS-42655-1 build with parameters screen, and everything worked as expected</em></li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>Hummm. Issue more or less reproduced. Let&#8217;s investigate more.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Restarted Jenkins again</em></li>
<li><em>Changed the JENKINS-42655 seed job configuration to use a different script</em></li>
<li><em>Copied the config.xml file to another location</em></li>
<li><em>Went to build with parameters, and now it was broken again</em></li>
<li><em>Saved the job manually</em></li>
<li><em>Copied the config.xml file to yet another location</em></li>
<li><em>Went to build with parameters, and now it worked as reported in this issue</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Now comes the interesting part. Looking at the diff. Attaching a screen shot so that others can have fun looking at it too. I installed Kompare as it has some cool features such as disabling diff for white spaces, blank lines, etc. The whole file changes as you save it. But if you ignore the number of white spaces&#8230; Then you can see that the Job DSL Plug-in is creating a &lt;script&gt; tag, as we used to do before 1.5 I think.</em></p>

<p><em>Now we use the script-security-plugin. So we need to wrap that around the script-security-plugin&#8217;s tags. Will report an issue for job-dsl-plugin, and will probably submit a pull request in the next days too. There&#8217;s not much left we can change in the plug-in code for that Piotr Tempes, so I&#8217;m afraid you will have to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>keep saving the job</em></li>
<li><em>perhaps work on the fix for Job DSL if you feel like doing it (as you could probably be faster than me in submitting the PR)</em></li>
<li><em>use an older version of the active-choices-plugin that doesn&#8217;t use security-script-plugin, though you could be bitten by other old bugs</em></li>
<li><em>write some script to replace the &lt;script&gt; tag and wrap it by the secureScript (doing what the pull request will do automatically later)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sorry for not being able to quickly provide any workaround, nor to cut a quick bugfix release.</em></p>
<p><em>Cheers</em>
<em>Bruno</em></p>

<p>ps: When I started getting involved in Open Source, I always felt extremely happy when
people would spend their time troubleshooting my issues, or just educating me on how to
behave in an Open Source community, or even how I should have troubleshooted initially
the issue myself. So whenever I have time, I try to write detailed and polite replies. The
person posting the comment is my past. The person posting the comment is my future :-)

    <title>Writing a binary parser in Python: NumPy vs. Construct</title>
    <pubDate>Apr 14, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/04/14/writing-a-binary-parser-in-python-numpy-vs-construct</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Some time ago I worked with researchers to write a parser for an old data format. The data
was generated by device (radiosonde) using the vendor (Vaisala) specific binary format.</p>
<p>One of the researchers told me someone had written a parser for his work, and shared it
on GitHub. To be honest, that was my first time parsing data in binary with Python. Did
that before with C, C++, Perl, and Java, but never with Python.</p>
<p>The code on GitHub used <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> and looked similar to this one.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">np</span>

<span class="n">parse_header</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dtype</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="s">&#39;field_a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;b1&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;field_b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;17b1&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;input.dat&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;rb&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">header</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fromfile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dtype</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">parse_header</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c"># ...</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And it indeed worked fine. But in the end I used the code - after contacting the author and letting
him know what I was about to do - as reference together with an old specification document
for the format, and created a parser with <a href="https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Construct</a>.</p>
<p>From Construct&#8217;s website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct is a powerful declarative parser (and builder) for binary data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what the code with construct looked like.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">construct</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>

<span class="n">parse_header</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Struct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;parse_header&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Byte</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;file_ready&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
        <span class="n">READY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">NOT_READY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">_default_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;UNKNOWN&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

    <span class="n">OptionalGreedyRange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">detailed_data</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c"># ...</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Writing the parser with NumPy or Construct would achieve the same result. However, in the end
this came down to personal preference, and my point of view as Software Engineer. This is the
description of NumPy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NumPy is a project tailored for scientific computing, with a focus on linear algebra,
N-dimensional arrays, and so it goes. While it contains code that can parse binary data,
the footprint added to a project that includes it as dependency is quite big.</p>
<p>The parser written with NumPy wasn&#8217;t using 5% of the NumPy code base. Probably less than 1%. Updates
to NumPy could break the application compatibility, even if the update came due to some new
matrix operation added to NumPy through some external and missing dependency.</p>
<p>In Java something similar happens with Google Guava. While I use it some times, most of the
times I find myself using one of the Apache Commons libraries, or another dependency
with just what I need. To avoid including unnecessary code to my application.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use NumPy that&#8217;s fine too :-) I just had the time enough to rewrite it
instead of using the NumPy (took a couple of hours). In other cases it may still
make sense to use another tool or library, even if it was not made specifically for the
job ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>

    <title>Spring Cloud encrypted values and Spring PropertySources</title>
    <pubDate>Apr 14, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/04/14/spring-cloud-encrypted-values-and-spring-propertysources</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>As I could not find any documentation for that, I decided to write it as a note to myself
in case I use the
<a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html#_encryption_and_decryption">encryption and decryption</a>
with Spring Cloud again.</p>
<p>In Spring and Spring Boot, you normally have multiple sources of properties, like multiple
properties files, environment properties and variables, and so it goes. In the Spring API,
these are represented as
<a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySource.html">PropertySource</a>&#8216;s.</p>
<p>In a Spring Boot application, you would be used to overriding certain properties
by defining environments and using an application-production.properties file, or
overriding values with environment properties.</p>
<p>This is common in
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/deploying-a-spring-boot-application-on-aws-using-aws-elastic-beanstalk/">Spring Boot applications deployed to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk</a>.</p>
<p>Some time ago another team at work found that overriding did not always work when you have
encrypted values in your properties files. Even if you specified new values in the
Amazon Elastic Beanstalk application configuration.</p>
<p>Yesterday, while debugging the issue and reading Spring Cloud source code, I found its
<a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/blob/9675df02f6a2c01766711f7dee3c4d2818b7d716/spring-cloud-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/bootstrap/encrypt/EnvironmentDecryptApplicationInitializer.java#L44">EnvironmentDecryptApplicationInitializer</a>.</p>
<p>It basically iterates through all loaded property sources, looking for values that start with
{cipher}. Then it calls the
<a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/apidocs/org/springframework/security/crypto/encrypt/TextEncryptor.html">Spring Security TextEncryptor</a>
defined in the application.</p>
<p>Finally, it creates a new property source, called decrypted, with the decrypted values. So when
your application looks for a property called XPTO, and if it has been encrypted, it will
find the value in the decrypted propery source, regardless of whether you tried to override it or
not.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Property sources listed in Eclipse IDE</span>

<span class="o">[</span>
  servletConfigInitParams,
  servletContextInitParams,
  systemProperties,
  systemEnvironment,
  random,
  applicationConfigurationProperties,
  springCloudClientHostInfo,
  defaultProperties
<span class="o">]</span>

<span class="c"># When using encrypted values</span>

<span class="o">[</span>
  decrypted, &lt;-------- created by Spring Cloud, with decrypted values. Prepended to the list of property sources
  servletConfigInitParams,
  servletContextInitParams,
  systemProperties,
  systemEnvironment,
  random,
  applicationConfigurationProperties,
  springCloudClientHostInfo,
  defaultProperties
<span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>So in case you have encrypted values in your Spring application (and you are using Spring Cloud, 
of course) remember that these values will have higher priority, and can only be overriden by other
encrypted values.</p>

    <title>Contributing to Apache Jena</title>

    <description><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="2014/10/11/basic-workflow-of-a-sparql-query-in-fuseki.html">previous post</a>, 
I am using <a href="http://jena.apache.org">Apache Jena</a> for a project of a customer. I had never used 
any triple store, nor a SPARQL Endpoint server before. But for being involved with the Apache 
Software Foundation, and since the company itself is using several Apache components, it was only 
natural Jena to be our first choice.</p>
<p>It has served us very well so far. At the moment we have less than 100 queries per day, but the 
project is still under development and we expect 1000 queries per day by the first quarter of 
2015 and 1000000 near the end of 2015. We also have few entries in TDB, but expect to grow this 
number to a few million before 2016.</p>
<p>When I work for companies and we use Open Source Software (OSS) in a project, I always 
prepare assessment reports to include in the deliveries. In this report I justify the choice 
of Open Source Software (as well as commercial software). Sometimes I 
am lucky to work for a company that asks me to include hours to work on OSS :-)</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> to triage issues in OSS projects (and for several other 
things). I have a board with several cards for Open Source. About a month ago I set up one 
for Jena and listed the issues that I thought I could contribute to. </p>

</div>

<p>I annotate easy issues with a &#8220;lhf&#8221; suffix for Low Hanging Fruit issues, and delete issues from 
the card once I submit a patch or update it (and include it in another card for the 
<a href="http://tupilabs.com/tag/tupilabs-report.html">TupiLabs reports</a>).</p>
<p>Most of the issues I included in the card for Jena had been created over two years ago, and hadn&#8217;t 
been updated in a while. When you test these issues against the current code, usually you find that 
some of them have already been fixed. Other issues included documentation problems, and minor features. I didn&#8217;t find any blocker issue that would impede us to use Jena in production.</p>

<p>The picture above shows the past 30 days activity summary in JIRA for Jena. The red line shows 
issues created, and the green line issues resolved. <a href="https://github.com/afs">Andy Seaborne</a> 
was very active in the past days and fixed several issues that were too old and had already been fixed in the trunk, and kindly merged patches and pull requests.</p>
<p>Some issues like <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-632">JENA-632</a> will take a 
longer time to fix, but I&#8217;m getting used to Jena&#8217;s source code, and at the same getting more 
confident to use it in production - especially with a supportive OSS community. We are using 
Jena for RDF with Hadoop, and I learned that I can replace some custom Writables by others 
in the Jena Hadoop submodule.</p>
<p>By the way, even though this project ends in April, I intend to continue contributing to Jena. 
There is a lot of parts of the code that I would love to be able to understand and contribute, 
in special the Graph database, optimization techniques for SPARQL queries, the grammars used 
in the project, Fuseki v2 and enhance its testing harness (as well as the test coverage).</p>
<p><strong>If you are looking for a interesting project to get you started with semantics, linked data, 
RDF, and even graphs and database querying, try contributing to Jena. I bet you&#8217;ll have a lot 
of fun!</strong></p>
<p>Happy hacking and happy 2015!</p></description>

    <title>Basic workflow of a SPARQL query in Fuseki</title>
    <pubDate>Oct 11, 2014</pubDate>
    <link>/2014/10/11/basic-workflow-of-a-sparql-query-in-fuseki</link>

    <description><p>Before using any library or tool in a customer project, specially when it is an Open Source one, 
there are many things that I like to look at before deploying it. Basically, I look at the 
features, documentation, community, open issues (in special blockers or criticals), the time 
to release fixes and new features and, obviously, the license.</p>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;m using <a href="http://jena.apache.org">Apache Jena</a> to work with ontologies, SPARQL 
and data matching and enrichment for a customer. </p>
<p>Jena is fantastic, and similar tools include <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/VirtuosoUniversalServer">Virtuoso</a>, 
<a href="http://stardog.com/">StarDog</a>, <a href="http://www.ontotext.com/products/ontotext-graphdb-owlim/">GraphDB</a>, 
<a href="http://4store.org/">4Store</a> and others. From looking at the code and its community and documentation, 
Jena seems like a great choice. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still investigating if/how we gonna need to use inference and reasoners, looking 
at the issues, and learning my way through its code base. The following is my initial mapping 
of what happens when you submit a SPARQL query to Fuseki.</p>
<div class='row'>

</a>

</div>

<p>My understanding is that Fuseki is just a web layer, handling a bunch of validations, logging, 
error handling, and relying on the ARQ module, that is who actually handles the requests. 
I also think a new Fuseki server is baking in the project git repo, so stay tuned for an 
updated version of this graph soon.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p></description>

    <title>Cypher, Gremlin and SPARQL: Graph dialects</title>
    <pubDate>Sep 09, 2014</pubDate>
    <link>/2014/09/09/cypher-gremlin-and-sparql-graph-dialects</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>When I was younger and my older brother was living in Germany, I asked him if he 
had learned German. He said that he did, and explained that there are several 
dialects, and he was quite proud for some people told him that he was using the 
Bavarian dialect correctly.</p>
<p>Even though <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/learn/cypher">Cypher</a>, 
<a href="http://gremlindocs.com/">Gremlin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> 
are all query languages, I think we can consider them dialects of a common graph language. 
Cypher is the query language used in <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">neo4j</a>, a graph database. 
Gremlin is part of the <a href="http://www.tinkerpop.com/">Tinkerpop</a>, an open source project 
that contains graph server, graph algorithms, graph language, among other sub-projects. 
And last but not least, SPARQL is used to query <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF documents</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use the example of the Matrix movie provided by neo4j to take a look at the 
three languages.</p>
<h2>Cypher</h2>
<p>First we create the graph.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s load our example (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/kendall">Kendall G. Clark</a>). I used

<div class="highlight"><pre>@prefix :          <span class="nt">&lt;http:</span><span class="err">//example.org/matrix</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span> .

 :m3 a :Movie; :title &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;; :year &quot;2003-10-27&quot;.

 :neo a :Actor; :name &quot;Keanu Reeves&quot;.
 :morpheus a :Actor; :name &quot;Laurence Fishburne&quot;.
 :trinity a :Actor; :name &quot;Carrie-Anne Moss&quot;.

 :neo :hasRole [:as &quot;Neo&quot;; :in :m1].

 :neo :hasRole [:as &quot;Neo&quot;; :in :m2].

 :trinity :hasRole [:as &quot;Trinity&quot;; :in :m2].
 :trinity :hasRole [:as &quot;Trinity&quot;; :in :m2].

<p>And finally the SPARQL query.</p>

<p>SPARQL supports inference (or I must say that OWL, RDFS and the reasoners do), 
but it is easier to define the depth of a search in the graph using neo4j. As for 
Gremlin, it has native support to Groovy and Java. There is a common denominator 
for these three languages, but what makes them really powerful are their unique features. </p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed, and that this post gave you a quick overview of some of the existing 
graph languages. Make sure you ponder the pros and cons of each server/language, and 
make the best decision for your project. Take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database#APIs_and_Graph_Query.2FProgramming_Languages">other graph query languages</a> too.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

    <title>Strings transliteration in Java with Apache Commons Lang</title>
    <pubDate>Aug 09, 2014</pubDate>
    <link>/2014/08/09/strings-transliteration-in-java-with-apache-commons-lang</link>

    <description><p><a href="http://rosalind.info">Rosalind</a> is a website with a curated set of exercices for bioinformatics, organized hierarchily. 
In some of these examples you are required to replace characters (nucleotides) by other characters. It is a rather common 
task for developers, like when you need to replace special characters in user&#8217;s names.</p>
<p>There are different ways of describing it, such as translate, replace, or <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration">transliterate</a></strong>. The latter being my favorite definition. </p>
<p>In Python I know that there are several different ways of transliterating strings 
[<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transliterate">1</a>][<a href="http://blog.lebowtech.com/blog/programming/python/transliterate-with-python.html">2</a>]. But in Java I always ended up using a Map or a Enum and writing my own method in some <em>Util</em> class for that.</p>
<p>Turns out that <a href="http://commons.apache.org">Apache Commons Lang</a>, which I use in most of my projects, 
provided this feature. What means that I will be able to reduce the length of my code, what also means 
less code to be tested (and one less place to look for bugs).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StringUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">replaceChars</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;ATGCATGC&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;GTCA&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;CAGT&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// &quot;TACGTACG&quot;</span>
<span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>What the code above does, is replace G by C, T by A, C by G and A by T. This process is part of finding the 
<a href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html">DNA reverse complement</a>. But you can also use this for replacing 
special characters, spaces by _, and so it goes.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p></description>

    <title>Treemapping Jenkins Extension Points with R</title>
    <pubDate>May 19, 2014</pubDate>
    <link>/2014/05/19/treemapping-jenkins-extension-points-with-r</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>I have been playing with R and its packages for some time, and decided to study it a 
bit harder. Last week I started reading the <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/">Advanced R Programming</a> 
by Hadley Wickham. </p>
<p>One of the first chapters talks about the basic data structures in R. In order to 
get my feet wet I thought about a simple example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">treemapping</a> 
Jenkins extension points. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/2014/05/19/treemapping-jenkins-extension-points-with-r/extension_points.png"><img src="/2014/05/19/treemapping-jenkins-extension-points-with-r/extension_points.png" width="600px" alt="Treemap graph" /></a></p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extension+points">Wiki page with the extension points in Jenkins</a> (what parts of Jenkins can be customized) 
and its implementations. That page is generated by a <a href="https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/view/Infrastructure/job/infra_extension-indexer/">Jenkins job</a>. </p>
<p>That job outputs a JSON file that contains each available extension points, as well as 
an array with its implementations. The R code below will produce two vectors, one with the 
count of implementations of each extension point, and the other with the class name.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>nExtensionPoints <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="kp">length</span><span class="p">(</span>extensionPointsJson<span class="o">$</span>extensionPoints<span class="p">)</span>
numberOfImplementations <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="kt">vector</span><span class="p">(</span>length <span class="o">=</span> nExtensionPoints<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>For creating the treemap I used the <strong><a href="http://flowingdata.com/2010/02/11/an-easy-way-to-make-a-treemap/">portfolio package</a></strong>, and the <code>map.market</code> 
function. The structures previously created and the next snippet of code are all that is 
needed to create the treemap of the Jenkins extension points.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>map.market<span class="p">(</span>id<span class="o">=</span><span class="kp">seq_along</span><span class="p">(</span>extensionPoints<span class="p">),</span> area<span class="o">=</span>numberOfImplementations<span class="p">,</span> group<span class="o">=</span>namesOfTheExtensionPoints<span class="p">,</span> color<span class="o">=</span>numberOfImplementations<span class="p">,</span> main<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;Jenkins Extension Points&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can also use the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/R+Plugin">Jenkins R Plug-in</a> to produce this graph, 
as in this <a href="http://builds.tupilabs.com/job/backend-extension-points-treemap/2/">sample job</a>. 
You can get the complete script in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/kinow/d5a2221c32dce3aa1076">gist</a>, or just

    <title>Writing a custom SchemaSpy command for Laravel 4</title>
    <pubDate>Feb 11, 2014</pubDate>
    <link>/2014/02/11/writing-a-custom-schemaspy-command-for-laravel-4</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>This week I had to write my first custom command for <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel 4</a>. 
In <a href="http://nestor-qa.org/">Nestor-QA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tooh">Peter</a> and I thought it would be useful to have 
the database schema being automatically generated with 
<a href="http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/">SchemaSpy</a> in our <a href="http://builds.tupilabs.com/view/Nestor-QA/">Jenkins box</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/artisan">Artisan</a> this task is much simpler than I thought. 
The following command creates the <code>schemaspy</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>php artisan command:make SchemaSpyCommand --command=schemaspy
</code></pre>
<p>This will create the file <code>app/commands/SchemaSpyCommand.php</code>. And all I had to do was 
just fill in the options and write the exec command as the <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/commands">Laravel 4 docs</a> explain. </p>
<pre><code>$this-&gt;info('Creating SchemaSpy');

$jar = $this-&gt;option("jar");
$dbtype = $this-&gt;option("dbtype");
$output = $this-&gt;option("output");

$commandLine = sprintf("java -jar %s -u none -t %s -o %s", $jar, $dbtype, $output);

$this-&gt;info(sprintf("Command line: [%s]", $commandLine));

exec($commandLine);
</code></pre>
<p>That&#8217;s how my final command looks. Now the final step is integrate it into the application by adding the line below to 
<code>app/start/artisan.php</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Artisan::add(new SchemaSpyCommand);
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#8217;s it, running <code>php artisan schemaspy --jar=/opt/schemaspy/schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar 
--dbtype=app/database/sqlite.properties --output=database-schema</code> 
creates the database schema docs in the <code>database-schema</code> directory. </p>
<p>Check this <a href="https://gist.github.com/kinow/8936667">gist</a> for the final code.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p></description>

    <title>Missing menus in new installation of TestLink 1.9.8</title>
    <pubDate>Oct 27, 2013</pubDate>
    <link>/2013/10/27/missing-menus-in-new-installation-of-testlink</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>I recently installed TestLink 1.9.8 and noticed that the menus and some other parts 
of the UI we missing. Looking at <code>/var/log/testlink/userlog1.log</code> (the location 
may change depending on your settings) I realized that there was something wrong 
with my PHP installation. There were log messages like the below.</p>
<pre><code>include_once(ADORecordSet_ext_empty.class.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory - in /home/kinow/php/workspace/testlink-1.9.8/lib/functions/common.php - Line 92
[13/Sep/18 12:51:09][WARNING][2o0h173pdgg5fjqh1pukr83og2][GUI]
E_WARNING
include_once(): Failed opening 'ADORecordSet_ext_empty.class.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear:.:/home/kinow/php/workspace/testlink-1.9.8/lib/functions/:/home/kinow/php/workspace/testlink-1.9.8/lib/issuet
...
</code></pre>
<p>I found a post in a forum (but unfortunately I forgot to save the link) that suggested 
these ADORecordSet were being caused by the module <strong>php5-adodb</strong>. Removing the module, and 
cleaning the templates cache directory (<code>$TESTLINK_HOME/gui/templates_c/*</code>) 
fixed the issue for me.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.
Happy testing!</p></description>

    <title>The Apache Way and on writing software reviews</title>
    <pubDate>Sep 29, 2013</pubDate>
    <link>/2013/09/29/the-apache-way-and-on-writing-software-reviews</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>The <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">Apache Way</a> is the philosophy behind 
Apache Software Foundation and is shared by all of its projects. It is composed by a set of principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative software development</li>
<li>Commercial-friendly standard license</li>
<li>Consistently high quality software</li>
<li><strong>Respectful, honest, technical-based interaction</strong></li>
<li>Faithful implementation of standards</li>
<li>Security as a mandatory feature</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been part of <a href="http://commons.apache.org">Apache Commons</a> for a while, and haven&#8217;t 
really contributed much yet. Maybe because I had lots of projects related to 
<a href="http://tupilabs.com">TupiLabs</a> as well as my own wedding this year. But I can 
assure that <em>respectful, honest, technical-based interaction</em> is quite right (not to discredit the 
other items, of course).</p>
<p>Even though there are critics of the Apache Way (<a href="/2013/09/29/the-apache-way-and-on-writing-software-reviews%231">1</a>, <a href="/2013/09/29/the-apache-way-and-on-writing-software-reviews%232">2</a>, <a href="/2013/09/29/the-apache-way-and-on-writing-software-reviews%233">3</a>), it still stands as an important 
pillar for the Apache Software Foundation, and its principles help to create stable and 
production ready software, such as <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Apache Hadoop</a>, 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache Httpd</a>, <a href="http://commons.apache.org/lang">Apache Commons Lang</a>, 
among <a href="http://projects.apache.org">others</a>.</p>
<p>There are many reviews and comparisons on Apache software (as well as on 
other software, like JavaScript libraries, Java Web Frameworks, Ruby Web servers and so on). 
Sometimes, though, these reviews or comparisons can be biased or not well founded. In 
cases like this, the developers of the tools may be frustrated, or users can be 
misled and choose the software based on wrong assertions.</p>
<p>I have just returned from honey moon, ready to start writing code again, but 
first I had to read all the unread messages in my inbox. Some were e-mails from <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html">Apache 
mailing lists</a>. <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/uoh5m55mh4qjybaw">One of these e-mails</a> 
had Phil Steitz comments on a post by Daniel Wu. </p>
<p>Instead of publishing his performance benchmark results of 
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/pool">Apache Commons Pool</a>, Daniel posted his 
code to the commons-dev mailing list. Phil Steitz, one of Apache Commons Pool 
committers replied with questions and a few points that Daniel could use to 
enrich his bechmark tests.</p>
<p>This kind of behavior happens a lot within Apache (at least in the mailing lists that 
I follow), and it produces a lot of benefits for different parts. </p>
<ul>
<li>The person writing a review or comparison can get the programmer opinion before actually 
publishing anything. </li>
<li>The programmer can see how other people were testing his/her code.</li>
<li>All other commons-pool committers and maintainers, the mailing list readers, and 
people that found the mailing list archives will be able to read the conversation 
history.</li>
<li>No misguided benchmark results were published (and lots of wrong decisions were avoided).</li>
</ul>
<p>I keep loving the Apache Way and the resulting community and code around it. There are 
always lots of things to learn, the Open Source projects communities are healthy and you will always find 
people willing to share their experience and time teaching you.</p>
<p>♥ Open Source</p>

    <title>Too many SQL variables exception in Graphite with SQLite3</title>
    <pubDate>Jul 04, 2013</pubDate>
    <link>/2013/07/04/too_many_sql_variables_in_graphite_with_sqlite3</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Having run <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> for a while, today I found a rather annoying issue. We were using 
<a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~lucio.torre/graphite/add-events/+merge/69142">events</a>, and everything was working perfectly fine so far. But for the 24 last hours, 
the graph was blank. </p>
<p>Actually, in the dashboard, the graph was <em>missing</em>, being displayed as a gray box. 
Enabling the web inspector in Google Chrome I got the graph URL. Opening the link in 
a new tab gave me the exception message: <strong>too many SQL variables</strong> (<sup>1</sup>).</p>
<p>After some research, I found out this was a bug in SQLite. After trying to hack the code, 
and being concerned about using a patched version of Graphite and having to update it 
later, I decided to switch database. </p>
<p>But to avoid losing the graphs, users and other settings, including the events, I 
migrated the SQLite database to a MySQL server. This MySQL server was already installed in 
the server machine, since this machine hosted a <a href="http://www.zabbix.com/">Zabbix</a> server too.</p>
<p>Here are the steps required to migrate your database from SQLite to MySQL (<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Download <strong>sqlite3_mysql</strong> python script from <a href="http://www.redmine.org/boards/2/topics/12793">http://www.redmine.org/boards/2/topics/12793</a></li>
<li>Stop Apache/Nginx</li>
<li>mysql -u user -p -e &#8220;create database redmine graphite set utf8;&#8221; </li>
<li>sqlite3 graphite.db .dump | sqlite3-to-mysql.py | mysql -uroot -pyourpass graphite</li>
<li>Start Apache again</li>
</ul>
<p>After tail&#8217;ing the Graphite webapp log file, </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>tail f- storage/log/webapp/error.log

<p>I noticed the Python MySQLdb wasn&#8217;t installed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">ImproperlyConfigured</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Error</span> <span class="n">loading</span> <span class="n">MySQLdb</span> <span class="n">module</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">No</span> <span class="n">module</span> <span class="n">named</span> <span class="n">MySQLdb</span>
</pre></div>

<p>My server was an Ubuntu 13.04, so I installed the module simply with the following 
command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>apt-get install python-mysqldb
</pre></div>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

    <title>Graphite: Broken images</title>

    <description><p>This morning I was setting up a <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/" title="Graphite">Graphite </a>server to collect metrics with <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/" title="statsd">statsd</a>, <a href="http://logstash.net/" title="LogStash">LogStash </a>and <a href="https://github.com/jmxtrans/jmxtrans" title="jmxtrans">jmxtrans</a>. After following the instructions from @jgeurst, I&#8217;ve successfully installed Graphite.</p>

<p>I had previously installed another test box, so I decided to take a deeper look at the settings, write a <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/" title="Puppet">puppet</a> manifest and prepare this new box to become a production server. However, after browsing the webapp, all graphs were broken.</p>

<p>After googling a while, reading forums and bugs, I decided to open the <em>$GRAPHITE_HOME/webapp/graphite/render/views.py</em>, adding <em>log.rendering(&#8230;)</em> statements (not the most elegant solution, I know).</p>

<p>By following the program workflow I found out it was entering a block after checking if it should remotely render the image. This feature is turned on/off by <strong>REMOTE_RENDERING</strong> = True/False, in local_settings.py.</p>

<p>After setting this to <em>False</em> the problem was solved.</p></description>

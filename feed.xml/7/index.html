    <title>Writing code to integrate Java projects to Testopia</title>

    <description><p><em>Peter Florijn</em> and I are writing a <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins CI">Jenkins</a> plug-in to <em>integrate several test tools into Jenkins</em>, something similar to what is done in <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin" title="Jenkins TestLink Plug-in">TestLink plug-in</a>. It&#8217;s still an idea being explored, and the whole project is subjected to changes without warning. The code is at <a href="https://github.com/kinow/testthemall" title="https://github.com/kinow/testthemall">https://github.com/kinow/testthemall</a>.</p>
<p>The first tool that we are integrating is not <a href="http://www.teamst.org" title="TestLink">TestLink</a>, but <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/testopia/" title="Mozilla Testopia">Mozilla Testopia</a>. As part of the process to integrate these tools, many Java API&#8217;s to interface the existing external APIs will be created, like it was done in TestLink with <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/testlinkjavaapi/" title="TestLink Java API">TestLink Java API</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/2012/05/18/writing-coding-to-integrate-java-projects-to-testopia/Jenkins1_300_224.png" alt="" title="Jenkins CI" height="128" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-978" /><img src="/2012/05/18/writing-coding-to-integrate-java-projects-to-testopia/testopia_128_128.png" alt="" title="Testopia" width="128" height="128" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979" /></p>

<p>Installing Testopia is very easy and straightforward. <a href="http://blog.marcweigand.de/2011/02/20/how-to-setup-bugzilla-with-testopia-on-a-new-debian-squeeze-60/" title="http://blog.marcweigand.de/2011/02/20/how-to-setup-bugzilla-with-testopia-on-a-new-debian-squeeze-60/">This</a> was the best guide that I could find, and worked without errors at my Debian Squeeze. I only had to move the directories from <code>/var/www</code> to my home directory (I use my PHP Eclipse workspace as Apache home).</p>
<p>Testopia has a XML-RPC APi, just like TestLink, however it lacks an user friendly documentation and examples. I migrated the Java driver from Ant to Maven, for the sake of commodity. But the XML-RPC server is complaining that I have to log-in before listing the test cases of a test plan.</p>
<p>If you are interested in using Java and Testopia, here&#8217;s the link for the java project with Maven support: <a href="https://github.com/kinow/testopia-java-driver" title="https://github.com/kinow/testopia-java-driver">https://github.com/kinow/testopia-java-driver</a>. I will update the project with examples, more tests and will try to clean up the code. Probably I will use either GitHub pages or a Wiki somewhere to document how to use Testopia and Java. </p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p></description>

    <title>Maven site tips: Maven Fluido Skin and Javadoc class diagrams</title>
    <pubDate>Apr 06, 2012</pubDate>
    <link>/2012/04/06/maven-site-tips-maven-fluido-skin-and-javadoc-class-diagrams</link>

    <description><p>I have been using Maven sites for a while, and am very happy with it. I didn&#8217;t like to have to update my projects after Maven 3, but that was all right, Maven 3 brought many new cool things. However, there were two things that annoyed me: lack of a nice and modern skin, and browsing Javadoc of complex code. The thought of creating a custom Maven skin even crossed my mind, but I never had time to read about it.</p>

<p>But the world is full of good and talented people! Like the guys from <a title="99soft" href="http://www.99soft.org/">99soft</a>. They created <a title="Maven Fluido Skin" href="http://maven.apache.org/skins/maven-fluido-skin/">Maven Fluido Skin</a>, and donated it to <a title="Apache Software Foundation" href="http://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>. It&#8217;s built on top of <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter&#8217;s Bootstrap</a> and available from Maven central repository. In order to use it in your Maven project, all that you have to do is add the following settings into your src/site/site.xml:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;skin&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.apache.maven.skins<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>maven-fluido-skin<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.2.1<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/skin&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here&#8217;s a list of some projects using Maven Fluido Skin (hopefully, in the near future <a title="Apache Commons" href="http://commons.apache.org/">Apache Commons</a> and other projects will adopt this skin as default too :-)):</p>

    <title>Ranges in Apache Commons Functor</title>
    <pubDate>Jan 22, 2012</pubDate>
    <link>/2012/01/22/ranges-in-apache-functor</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>This is a long post. So here is a <strong>TL;DR</strong>:
<ul>
    <li>Apache Commons Functor has no Double or Float Range (yet)</li>
    <li>Apache Commons Functor IntegerRange and LongRange treat the low value as inclusive, and the high value as exclusive. How does that compare to other languages/APIs? (you will have to read to see some comparison)</li>
    <li>Perl has support for characters ranges, perhaps we could implement it in Functor too?</li>
    <li>In case we implemented a CharacterRange, it would have to be inclusive for both low and high limits. With &#8216;z&#8217; being the last character, there wouldn&#8217;t have a way to include Z with the current approach. Or we would have to make the CharacterRange a special one. What would go against <a title="Liskov Substitution Principle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>.</li>
    <li>You can see a comparison table with Apache Commons Functor, other Java API&#8217;s and other programming languages for ranges clicking <a href="#ctable" title="Comparison table">here</a>.</li>
    <li>It would be nice to have a clear distinction in Functor documentation among a Sequence, a Generator and a Range. While I was gathering material for this post, I found places using range, others using sequence, and in Apache Commons Functor, an IntegerRange is a Generator.</li>
</ul>
Now, if you have some spare time or curiosity, keep reading :-)</p>

    <title>Testing shell code and producing TAP using Jenkins?</title>

    <description><p>Definitely reading <a title="Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> before going to bed is a bad idea :-) Same goes for <a title="Reddit" href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>. So, I found a link about <a title="Bats" href="https://github.com/sstephenson/bats">Bats</a>, a tool to execute tests in Shell and output <a title="Test Anything Protocol" href="http://testanything.org">TAP</a> - Test Anything Protocol. Then I thought; why not ask the author to include Bats under the list of <a title="TAP Producers" href="http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/TAP_Producers#SH_.2F_Shell_Script">Producers</a> in <a title="Test Anything Protocol" href="http://testanything.org">testanything.org</a>?</p>
<p>But you know what? Why not execute execute locally first to check if that&#8217;s working&#8230; moreover, why not use <a title="Jenkins TAP Plug-in" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin">Jenkins TAP Plug-in</a> and see what happens?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what is necessary.

    <title>Listing of current projects, achievements and my New Year's resolutions</title>

    <description><p>Tis&#8217; the end of 2011! Yay! Throughout this year I&#8217;ve heard people repeatedly saying that I had too much on my plate, and that I should quit some projects, stop giving talks, start surfing again amongst other things. Now, looking back, although I&#8217;m quite happy with my achievements in 2011, I can see their point.</p>
<p>In 2010 I started working as Software Quality Engineer with <a title="Anderson Santos" href="http://andersonxp.tumblr.com/">Anderson Santos</a>. He was the greatest supporter of many of my ideas, so although we stopped working together in 2011, I&#8217;m still grateful to him for all he taught, for his advices and for spending some time guiding me.</p>
<p>He motivated me to start giving talks, going to more conferences and contributing more actively to Open Source projects. Since then, I&#8217;ve given almost 10 talks, including one in <a title="Belgium Testing Days" href="http://www.belgiumtestingdays.com">Belgium Testing Days</a>, another one in<a title="Oracle JavaOne" href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/lad-pt/"> Oracle JavaOne</a> and in March next year I will be in America for a talk in <a title="STP Con" href="http://www.stpcon.com/">STPCON</a>. I also missed <a title="JCertif" href="http://www.jcertif.com">JCertif</a> conference in Congo due to visa problems and learned some lessons from it (so sorry Max :)</p>

    <title>Practical test doubles: adding stubs to TestLink Java API</title>
    <pubDate>Oct 23, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/10/23/practical-test-doubles-adding-stubs-to-testlink-java-api</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p><em>&#8220;<strong>Test Double</strong> is a generic term for any case where you replace a production object for testing purposes&#8221;</em> [<a href="#1">1</a>]. There are different types of Test Doubles: <strong>Dummy</strong>, <strong>Fake</strong>, <strong>Stubs</strong>, <strong>Spies</strong> and <strong>Mocks</strong>. In this post we will see a practical example of adding stubs to <a href="testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net" title="TestLink Java API">TestLink Java API</a>.</p>

<p>Stubs are objects that return canned answers to calls during tests [1]. This is useful specially when you have a system that communicates with different resources such as databases, web services, XML-RPC services and so on.</p>

<p>TestLink Java API is a small Java project created to act as an interface between <a href="http://www.teamst.org" title="TestLink">TestLink</a> XML-RPC API and a client program written in Java.</p>

    <title>Building Jenkins with Eclipse and m2e plug-in</title>
    <pubDate>Sep 20, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/09/20/building-jenkins-with-eclipse-and-m2e-plug-in</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Yesterday I finally managed to build <a title="Jenkins" href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> using <a title="Eclipse" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and <a title="m2e plug-in" href="http://eclipse.org/m2e/">m2e plug-in</a>. With <a title="Eclipse Indigo" href="http://www.eclipse.org/indigo">Eclipse Indigo</a> release came a new version of the <a title="Maven" href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> plug-in for Eclipse (former <a title="M2Eclipse" href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/">M2Eclipse</a>), m2e. Since I started using Eclipse Indigo and this new plug-in I hadn&#8217;t been able to build Jenkins in Eclipse anymore.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been having a terrible fever and thought that it would be a good thing to stop playing <a href="http://www.minecraft.net" title="Minecraft">Minecraft</a> for a while and find a way to build Jenkins in Eclipse + m2e :-).</p>

<h2>1. Maven Plug-ins execution in project life cycle</h2>

<p>The first thing I&#8217;ve noticed were the messages regarding the execution of some Maven plug-ins in the project life cycle. m2e delegates the execution of Maven plug-ins to an external executor. As not all Maven plug-ins have an existing executor for m2e you will receive a message similar to &#8220;Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: &#8230;&#8221;.</p>

    <title>Missed JCertif</title>
    <pubDate>Sep 07, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/09/07/missed-jcertif</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Unfortunately I missed JCertif last weekend. My visa was in Brazzaville but I couldn&#8217;t board in a flight from Johannesburg to Congo without it. Max Bonbhel kindly tried to fax me the visa, but the last flight to Congo closed and I had to come back to Brazil sooner. :-(</p>

<p>Here is the slides that I was going to use there. Hope you take some time to read about TAP, SubUnit and other test protocols. There are two special points to pay attention to, one single format and extensibility.</p>

<p  style=" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;">   <a title="View Jcertif 2011 Tap on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/64127001/Jcertif-2011-Tap"  style="text-decoration: underline;" >Jcertif 2011 Tap</a> by <a title="View brunodepaulak's profile on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/brunodepaulak"  style="text-decoration: underline;" >brunodepaulak</a></p>

<iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="http://www.scribd.com/embeds/64127001/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-bxtrnpq41waa1g8dc4a&show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="1.5" scrolling="no" id="doc_39777" width="640px" height="480px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>With a single format for your test results, you won&#8217;t need to write many different parsers, one for each distinct format. Extensibility refers to the fact that using formats like xUnit (like JUnit) or TestNG XML you are limited to the XML schema.</p>

<p>Many projects are aiming automation in different levels. Executing automated tests can lead to situations where you need to have information like the database used, JDK version, screen shots taken during some tests, exception stack traces, etc. TAP and SubUnit provide manners to extend your test result and inform to a test consumer (the tool that reads your test output) about such information.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p></description>

    <title>TDC 2011 Floripa presentation about running your tests in Jenkins</title>

    <description><p>Last weekend I attended TDC (<a title="The Developers Conference" href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br">The Developers Conference</a>) 2011 in Florian&oacute;polis, in the south of Brazil. It was my first time in Florian&oacute;polis, but the weather was cloudy and cold, so I couldn&#8217;t check out one of the prettiest cities in Brazil :-( Bummer.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="The Developers Conference" href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793" title="banner-TDC2011-180x36" src="/2011/08/25/tdc-2011-floripa-presentation-about-running-your-tests-in-jenkins/banner_TDC2011_floripapng" alt="" width="180" height="36" /></a></p>

<p>Putting the weather aside, TDC was great! Basically, there were many nice, easy-going people gathering together to talk about subjects like Java, SOA, Arduino, Testing, Agile and more. I had the chance to talk with skilled and experienced people, see different talks and catch up Guilherme Motta (<a title="@gfcmotta" href="http://www.twitter.com/gfcmotta">@gfcmotta</a>) from <a title="ThoughtWorks" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, who I have met in Porto Alegre in the beginning of this year. He gave an interesting talk about crowd testing using games as example, but varying with applications in different areas too.</p>

    <description><p>It&#8217;s been a while since the last time I posted something here. The reason is that I have been busy fixing bugs in <a title="Jenkins TestLink Plug-in" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin">Jenkins TestLink Plug-in</a>, <a title="TestLink" href="http://www.teamst.org">TestLink</a>, <a title="TestLink Java API" href="http://testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net/">TestLink Java API</a>, <a title="tap4j" href="http://www.tap4j.org">tap4j</a>, <a title="Jenkins TAP Plug-in" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin">Jenkins TAP Plug-in</a> and other Open Source projects.</p>
<p>Recently I left <a title="Sysmap Solutions" href="http://www.sysmap.com.br">Sysmap Solutions</a>, where I was a consultant, to have my labor card signed by <a title="Lojas Riachuelo" href="http://www.lojasriachuelo.com.br">Lojas Riachuelo</a>, a famous Brazilian fashion retailer (like C&amp;A, Zara, H&amp;M and so on), part of Guararapes group.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lojasriachuelo.com.br" title="Lojas Riachuelo"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-781" title="riachuelo" src="/2011/08/13/bug-hunting-new-job-and-preparing-presentations/riachuelo.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="125" /></a></p>

<p>So I am still getting used to the new routine, new systems and be a employee rather than a consultant.</p>
<p>There are also two talks to come, one in a few days at <a title="The Developers Conferecen" href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br">TDC</a> (The Developers Conference) 2011 in Florian&oacute;polis, and another one in the beginning of September at <a title="JCertif" href="http://www.jcertif.com">JCertif</a> in Congo/Brazzaville. While I already bought the tickets and booked the hotel rooms, I still have to finish some slides and practical examples for both events.</p>
<p>I already have two draft posts that I am still writing. One about continuous integration and parallelism/concurrency, and another one about spell check in DocBook projects, specially if you are using Maven.</p>
<p>Today I had a new idea for a bioinformatics tool that is may be helpful for researchers and bioinformatics professionals. I will write about it as soon as I find some spare time, so stay tuned ;)</p>
<p>Time to get back to work!</p>
<p>Cheers</p></description>

    <title>Why am I learning Perl? </title>
    <pubDate>Jun 15, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/06/15/why-am-i-learning-perl</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Last month I attended the <a title="II Sao Paulo Perl Workshop" href="http://www.perlworkshop.com.br">II Sao Paulo Perl Workshop</a>, where I had the privilege of learning with the great talks performed by <a title="Bryan D Foy" href="http://www252.pair.com/~comdog/">bryan d foy</a>, <a title="Brad FitzPatrick" href="http://bradfitz.com/">Brad FitzPatrick</a> and <a title="Larry Wall" href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/">Larry Wall</a>. For being a Java programmer, you can imagine how lost I was feeling there.</p>
<p>The first programming language that I had contact with was Perl. I was a 16 years old <a title="Slackware Linux" href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a> aficionado at that time, and was dying to have a web site with a guestbook . We did not have any cheap hosting services in Brazil that offered a <a title="PHP" href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> environment, but there were few companies that offered a free host with ads, and with Perl. I don&#8217;t remember which script I used, only that I found it in <a title="HotScripts.com" href="http://www.hotscripts.com">HotScripts.com</a> and that it stored the guestbook entries in disk. Now, ten years after, here I am playing with Perl again! :-D
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/06/15/why-am-i-learning-perl/larry_wall.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-740" title="Bruno and Larry @ II Sao Paulo Perl Workshop" src="/2011/06/15/why-am-i-learning-perl/larry_wall.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></a></p>
Well, what was my idea of Perl before the event? I thought it was an old programming language, very powerful, but over complicated. And what do I think of Perl now? I think it is an old programming language, very powerful, but may be complicated.</p>

    <title>A comparison of TAP (Test Anything Protocol) and SubUnit</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 04, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/06/04/a-comparison-of-tap-test-anything-protocol-and-subunit</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>
    I have been playing with <a href="http://www.testanything.org">TAP</a> for some time and even implemented a <a
        href="http://www.tap4j.org">Java API</a> to let <a href="http://www.testng.org">TestNG</a>, <a
        href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> and other Test Frameworks to produce and consume TAP. TAP is a standard
    format for test output that first appeared with Perl 1 in 1987. It is human and machine readable, easy to be
    serialized, language independent and extensible<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> through the use of <a
        href="http://www.yaml.org">YAML</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Some days ago while I was designing a plug-in to show TAP test results in <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a>
    I stumbled across a message in <a href="http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html">Jenkins
        dev-list</a> where Max Magee and Nick Wiesmueller were discussing about a way of showing more details about the test
    executions. I thought that the TAP Plug-in would fit perfectly, until one of the users, <a
        href="https://launchpad.net/~lifeless">Robert Collins</a>, mentioned <a href="https://launchpad.net/subunit">SubUnit</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Shame on me, but I hadn&#8217;t heard of SubUnit until that message. Max Magee and I exchanged some messages after that,
    talking about a initial design and analysis for the TAP Plug-in<sup>

<a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Here is the initial
    idea:
<p>
<ul>
    <li>The plug-in will be able to parse one or more test formats (maybe SubUnit, TAP and the formats available in
        xUnit?).</li>
    <li>The test results will be displayed the same way JUnit tests are displayed in Jenkins (I think Jenkins
        supports JUnit format by default, but you can use objects and create test results data, independently of the
        test framework that you are using).</li>
    <li>There will be a table containing the Test Name, Description and Status and an expandable section.</li>
    <li>Inside this expandable section will be available all the details about the test.</li>
    <li>In case there are images within the test details, they should be displayed as a lightbox gallery.<sup><a
            href="#3">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Although I have worked with TAP and spent some good time writing the tap4j port for Java, I am not convinced it is
    the best solution for this issue yet. Hence I am posting this initial comparison between TAP and SubUnit hoping that
    more people will contribute with the design of this solution. My goal is not only having a super cool plug-in for
    Jenkins, but ease integration of test results in different tools and collaborate with both TAP and SubUnit. Another
    objective that I have in mind is improving the way that test results are displayed in Jenkins and enabling it to be
    an alternative for tools like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smolder/">Smolder</a>, <a
        href="https://launchpad.net/testrepository">TestRepository</a> or <a href="https://launchpad.net/tribunal">Tribunal</a>.
    Because I believe the tasks done by these tools could be all done in my favorite CI Server, and it would increase
    the productivity of Build &amp; Release professionals :-))

    <title>Fa√ßa seus Testes Falarem TAP (Make your Tests Speak TAP) article published in MundoJ, issue 47, March/April 2011</title>
    <pubDate>May 23, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/05/23/faca-seus-testes-falarem-tap-make-your-tests-speak-tap-article-published-in-mundoj-issue-47-marchapril-2011</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>This is my first article for a Brazilian magazine! :-D It was published in this month&#8217;s issue of <a href="http://www.mundoj.com.br">MundoJ</a> magazine (previously called MundoJava).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/05/23/faca-seus-testes-falarem-tap-make-your-tests-speak-tap-article-published-in-mundoj-issue-47-marchapril-2011/ed47p.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-659 center" title="MundoJ issue 47" src="/2011/05/23/faca-seus-testes-falarem-tap-make-your-tests-speak-tap-article-published-in-mundoj-issue-47-marchapril-2011/ed47p.jpg" alt="" width="99" height="130" /></a></p>

<p>In this article Cesar Fernandes de Almeida, <a href="http://andersonxp.tumblr.com/">Anderson dos Santos</a> and I discuss how to make your Java tests output <a href="http://www.testanything.org">TAP</a> (Test Anything Protocol) Streams. This test protocol has been used by Perl developers since Perl&#8217;s first version (1983~) but hasn&#8217;t been used by many Java developers yet, unfortunately. We hope it incentives other Java developers to use TAP for their tests. There is an alternative to TAP too, <a href="https://launchpad.net/subunit">SubUnit</a>, which was pointed out for me by <a href="https://launchpad.net/~lifeless">Robert Collins</a> in the <a href="http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html">Jenkins dev-list</a> few weeks ago. Now I am preparing a comparison between TAP and SubUnit as an analysis before developing a plug-in for Jenkins to show detailed test results (such as exception, images, raw test, error line, etc). </p>
<p>Throughout the article we explain how to use <a href="http://www.tap4j.org">tap4j</a> to generate TAP Streams with <a href="http://www.testng.org">TestNG</a>, however it is possible to use the same approach to generate TAP Streams with <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.</p>
<p>Now I will translate the article to send it to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~patl/">Patrick LeBoutillier</a>, who contributed to this article answering patiently my questions by mail and writing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~patl/metatap-0.01/">metatap</a>, a utility that lets you check if a TAP Stream is valid, according to the program parameters. This utility is being used in tap4j for integration tests between Perl and Java.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I&#8217;m not allowed to redistribute the article, not even an English version of it :-(</p>
<p>Cheers :)</p></description>

    <title>TestLink and Hudson (now Jenkins) short tutorial in Automated Software Testing Magazine, issue March 2011</title>
    <pubDate>Mar 22, 2011</pubDate>

    <description><p>Hi there, a new article about TestLink and Hudson (now Jenkins) was published, now in <a title="Automated Software Institute" href="http://www.automatedtestinginstitute.com/">Automated Software Testing Magazine</a>, issue March 2011. In this article you will find a short tutorial to set up a TestNG test and a simple Job to execute your automated tests.
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.automatedtestinginstitute.com/home/ASTMagazine/2011/AutomatedSoftwareTestingMagazine_March2011.pdf"><img class="size-full wp-image-636 aligncenter" title="Automated Software Testing Magazine, issue March 2011." src="/2011/03/22/testlink-and-hudson-now-jenkins-short-tutorial-in-automated-software-testing-magazine-issue-march-2011/March11Cover_small.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="290" /></a></span></p>
Now we are writing a <a title="DocBook" href="http://www.docbook.org/">docbook</a> document to explain with more details how the plug-in works and how you can play with it. We are also working in more samples, translation and video demos. Release 2.2 was planned for last Friday but I missed the date to add a new feature: TestLink platforms, this is the last known limitation in the plug-in.</p>
<p>Cheers :-)</p></description>

    <title>Discussing the flexibility of TAP to cover information generated by TestNG</title>
    <pubDate>Mar 20, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/03/20/discussing-the-flexibility-of-tap-to-cover-information-generated-by-testng</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>In today&#8217;s post I am expanding the previous one regarding the use of <a title="TAP (Test Anything Protocol)" href="http://www.testanything.org">TAP</a> with <a title="TestNG" href="http://www.testng.org">TestNG</a>. Let&#8217;s discuss about the flexibility of TAP to cover information generated by TestNG, more specifically:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Expected Exceptions</li>
    <li>Data Providers</li>
    <li>Groups</li>
    <li>Tests that get skipped</li>
    <li>Dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be addressing these bullet points using <a title="tap4j" href="http://tap4j.sourceforge.net">tap4j</a>, a TAP implementation for Java. The integration between TAP and TestNG is done through the use of TestNG Listeners developed in tap4j project (a big thanks here to <a title="Cesar Fernandes de Almeida" href="http://www.cesinha.com">Cesar Fernandes de Almeida</a> for all his help).</p>

<p>There are two listeners in tap4j, <a title="br.eti.kinoshita.tap4j.ext.testng.TestTAPReporter" href="https://github.com/kinow/tap4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/tap4j/ext/testng/TestTAPReporter.java">br.eti.kinoshita.tap4j.ext.testng.TestTAPReporter</a> and <a title="br.eti.kinoshita.tap4j.ext.testng.SuiteTAPReporter" href="https://github.com/kinow/tap4j/blob/master/src/main/java/br/eti/kinoshita/tap4j/ext/testng/SuiteTAPReporter.java">br.eti.kinoshita.tap4j.ext.testng.SuiteTAPReporter</a>. The first was created based on <a title="org.testng.reporters.TestHTMLReporter" href="https://github.com/cbeust/testng/blob/master/src/main/java/org/testng/reporters/TestHTMLReporter.java">org.testng.reporters.TestHTMLReporter</a> and the latter was created based on <a title="org.testng.reporters.SuiteHTMLReporter" href="https://github.com/cbeust/testng/blob/master/src/main/java/org/testng/reporters/SuiteHTMLReporter.java">org.testng.reporters.SuiteHTMLReporter</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/03/20/discussing-the-flexibility-of-tap-to-cover-information-generated-by-testng/unnamed0.jpg"><img class="alignnone" title="Testing Tools as producers, TAP and consumers" src="/2011/03/20/discussing-the-flexibility-of-tap-to-cover-information-generated-by-testng/unnamed0.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="474" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: #999999; font-size: 0.8em;">In this figure you have testing tools as TAP producers (left) and different types of applications as consumers (right)</span></em></p>

    <title>Getting the maximum from TestNG with TAP</title>
    <pubDate>Mar 10, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/03/10/getting-the-maximum-from-testng-with-tap</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Strangely enough, today I decided start to write about <a href="http://www.testanything.org">TAP</a> (Test Anything Protocol) and received a mail from a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">Linkedin</a> Group with a white paper about data integration in information systems. Well, let me first explain what is TAP, or Test Anything Protocol. This protocol was created in the beginning of Perl to log test results and is still being used by Perl and other languages (<a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/">PHPUnit</a> can output TAP too, for instance).</p>

<p>Now, if you already know about TAP and YAML, or if you are like me and like trying things out before reading a long text, then go to the <a href="#hammertime">hands on part</a> of this post.</p>

<p>An output in TAP, or a TAP stream, is written in pure text in a human readable way. Like follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>TAP version 13
1..2
ok <span class="m">1</span> Test 1
not ok <span class="m">2</span> Missing <span class="nb">test </span>parameter: url
</pre></div>

    <title>Code coverage helps, but it's not enough</title>
    <pubDate>Jan 25, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/01/25/code-coverage-helps-but-not-enough</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Today I talked to two QA Engineers about code coverage and we all agreed that code coverage helps, but is not enough. And by coincidence today I had to fix a bug in <a title="tap4j - Test Anything Protocol API for Java" href="http://tap4j.sourceforge.net/">tap4j</a> that reminded me the same thing. My <a title="Cobertura homepage" href="http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/">cobertura</a> (the coverage tool that I was using at moment) report said that my code was covered by my tests. However there was a <em>bug in the covered code</em>.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="tap4j Cobertura report" href="http://tap4j.sourceforge.net/cobertura/index.html"><img class="size-medium wp-image-525  aligncenter" title="Cobertura code coverage" src="/2011/01/25/code-coverage-helps-but-not-enough/coverage.jpg" alt="Cobertura code coverage" width="300" height="165" /></a></p>
If you are curious about the code you can see this issue <a title="tap4j BUG #3165200" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=3165200&amp;group_id=351793&amp;atid=1470124">here</a>. However if you really would like to know more about code coverage, I suggest you to read this <a title="How to misuse code coverage - Brian Marick" href="http://www.exampler.com/testing-com/writings/coverage.pdf">fantastic article</a> written by Brian Marick in 99 with the title &#8220;How to misuse code coverage&#8221;.</p>
<p>I will finish this post now quoting him:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;they (code coverage tools) are only helpful if they&#8217;re used to enhance thought, not to replace it&#8221;.</blockquote>

<p>Cheers :-)</p></description>

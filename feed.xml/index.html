    <title>How to remove the signature from e-mails with NLP?</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 14, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/06/14/how-to-remove-the-signature-from-emails-with-nlp</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Some time ago I stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/mynameisvinn/EmailParser">EmailParser</a>, a Python utility to remove e-mail signatures. Here&#8217;s a sample input e-mail from the project documentation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Wendy – thanks for the intro! Moving you to bcc.

Hi Vincent – nice to meet you over email. Apologize for the late reply, I was on PTO for a couple weeks and this is my first week back in office. As Wendy mentioned, I am leading an AR/VR taskforce at Foobar Retail Solutions. The goal of the taskforce is to better understand how AR/VR can apply to retail/commerce and if/what is the role of a shopping center in AR/VR applications for retail.

Wendy mentioned that you would be a great person to speak to since you are close to what is going on in this space. Would love to set up some time to chat via phone next week. What does your availability look like on Monday or Wednesday?

Best,
Joe Smith

<p>And here&#8217;s what it looks like afterwards.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>As you can see, it removed all the lines after the main part of the message (i.e. after the three paragraphs). Here&#8217;s what the Python code looks like.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">Parser</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">read_email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">prob_block</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">spacy.en</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">English</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">msg_stripped</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">msg_raw</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c"># preprocessing text before POS tagging</span>

<span class="c"># iterate through lines, write to file if not signature block</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">generate_text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">msg_stripped</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pos_tagger</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;emails/test1_clean.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>What got me interested about this utility was the use of NLP. I couldn&#8217;t imagine how someone could use NLP for that. And I liked the simplicity of the approach, which is not perfect, but can be useful someday.</p>
<p>After the imports in the code, it creates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech">Part of Speech</a> tagger using <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a> NLP library, reads the e-mail from a file, and sripts and creates an array with each paragraph of the message.</p>
<p>The magic happens in the <code>generate_text</code> function, which receives the <strong>array of paragraphs</strong>, a <strong>threshold</strong>, the <strong>POS tagger</strong>, and the <strong>output destination</strong>. Here&#8217;s what the function does.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>for each message
    if probability ( signature block | message ) &lt; threshold
        write to output file
</pre></div>

<p>And the formula for calculating the probability is quite simple too.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>1. For a given paragraph (message block), find all the sentences in it.
2. Then for each word (token) in the sentence, count the number of times a non-verb appears.
3. Return the proportion of non-verbs per sentence, i.e. number of non-verbs / number of sentences.
</pre></div>

<p>In summary, it discards blocks that do not contain enough verbs to be considered a message block, being treated as signature blocks instead.</p>
<p>Never thought about using an approach like this. It may definitely be helpful when doing data analysis, information retrieval, or scraping data from the web. Not necessarily with e-mails and signatures, but you got the gist of it.</p>

    <title>Backward compatibility and switch statement with constant expressions</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 10, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/06/10/backward-compatibility-and-switch-statements-with-constant-expressions</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Maintaining Open Source software can be challenging. Making sure you keep backward compatibility (not only binary) can be even more challenging. <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/">Apache Commons Lang</a> 3.6 release is happening right now thanks to <a href="http://www.benediktritter.de/">Benedikt Ritter</a>, and it is on its fourth Release Candidate (i.e. RC4).</p>
<p>A previous RC2 was cancelled due to <a href="http://commons.markmail.org/thread/57sqt2hkusegda73#query:+page:1+mid:dnwo5tjqo2e5bwuo+state:results">IBM JDK 8 compatibility</a>, more specifically the lazy initialization of ArrayList&#8217;s seems to be different in Oracle JDK and IBM JDK.</p>
<p>The RC3 was cancelled due to a <a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/commit/18e692478dcf91fdceb9b9fdca7c61a1111d63aa">change</a> that could affect users using a switch statement.</p>
<p>The change was in the <em>CharEncoding</em> class. The issue was that this class has some constants, that stopped being <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.28">constant expressions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>A constant expression is an expression denoting a value of primitive type or a String that does not complete abruptly and is composed using only the following (&#8230;)</blockquote>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">CharEncoding</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">ISO_8859_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The code above contains a constant (<em>static final</em>) variable, that is a constant expression. So users can safely use it in switch statements, and the Java compiler won&#8217;t complain about it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">CharEncoding</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">ISO_8859_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StandardCharsets</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ISO_8859_1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">name</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The code above is from the change that caused the regression. Any user that was using the ISO_8859_1 constant variable in a switch statement would get a compilation error (e.g. <em>case expressions must be constant expressions</em>) when updating to Apache Commons Lang 3.6. That is because the constant variable is not a constant expression.</p>
<p>I think I learned that some time ago, but if you asked me what was wrong with the change, and if it would break backward compatibility, I would probably fail to spot the issue. There are tools for that now (e.g. Clirr, japicmp) though they may miss some cases too.</p>
<p>Luckily in this case a user subscribed to the Apache Commons development mailing list spotted the issue and quickly reported it. It gets easier maintaining an Open Source project with the constructive feedback of users, like this one.</p>

    <title>Securely using passwords with R</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 03, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/06/03/securely-using-passwords-with-r</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>It is quite common to have code that needs to interact with another system, database, or third party application, and need to use some sort of credentials to securely communicate.</p>
<p>Most of the code I wrote in <strong>R</strong>, or reviewed, had normally no borders (from a system analysis perspective) with other systems, or basically just interacted with the file system to retrieve NetCDF or JSON files.</p>
<p>However, after I saw a comment in <em>Reddit</em> [1] some time ago about this, I decided to check what others used. With <strong>R Shiny</strong> becoming more popular, and moving more R code to the web, I think this will become a common requirement for R code.</p>
<p>There is a blog post from <strong>RevolutionAnalytics</strong> [2] that does a nice summary of the options for that. The post is from 2015, but I do not think much changed now in 2017. From the blog post and comments, there are seven methods listed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/fishbaseapi/blob/80393023a958aee54e2daa58c337458db5480b84/config_template.yaml">credentials</a> in your source code</li>
<li>Put credentials in a file in your project, but do not share this file (<em>#3</em>, <em>#4</em>, and <em>#5</em> are similar to this one)</li>
<li>Put credentials in a <a href="https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/3-3-r-startup.html#rprofile">.Rprofile</a> file</li>
<li><strong>Put credentials in a <a href="https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/3-3-r-startup.html#renviron">.Renviron</a> file</strong></li>
<li>Put <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/fishbaseapi/blob/80393023a958aee54e2daa58c337458db5480b84/config_template.yaml">credentials</a> in a JSON or YAML file</li>
<li>Put credentials in a secure store that you can access from R</li>
<li>Ask the user for the credentials when the script is executed (possibly not useful for R Shiny applications)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My preferred way for R is the .Renviron (or a <a href="https://github.com/gaborcsardi/dotenv">dotEnv</a>) file</strong>. You basically store your password in this file, make sure you do not share this (a global gitignore could be helpful to prevent any accident) and read the variables when you start your code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">## Secrets</span>
MYSQL_PASSWORD<span class="o">=</span>secret
</pre></div>

<p>If you would like to increase the security, you can combine it with a variation of <em>#6</em>. You use a .Renviron file, and use an encryption service like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Amazon KMS</a> (KMS stands for Key Management Service).</p>
<p>With <a href="https://github.com/cardcorp/AWR.KMS">AWS KMS in R</a>, you can encrypt your values, put them encrypted in your .Renviron, and even if someone gets hold of your .Renviron file, you have an extra layer of protection, as the attacker would require access to your cloud environment to decrypt it too.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">## Secrets</span>
MYSQL_PASSWORD<span class="o">=</span>AQECAHga320J8WadplGCqqVAr4HNvDaFSQ<span class="o">+</span>NaiwIBhmm6qDSFwAAAGIwYAYJKoZIhvcNAQcGoFMwUQIBADBMBgkqhkiG9w0BBwEwHgYJYIZIAWUDBAEuMBEE99<span class="o">+</span>LoLdvYv8l41OhAAIBEIAfx49FFJCLeYrkfMfAw6XlnxP23MmDBdqP8dPp28OoAQ<span class="o">==</span>

    <title>Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 03, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/06/03/natural-language-processing-and-natural-language-understanding</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing"><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong></a> (NLP) tools in a few projects in the past years. But only recently, while involved with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot">chatbot</a> project, I noticed the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_understanding"><strong>Natural Language Understanding</strong></a> (NLU).</p>
<p>NLU can be seen as a subfield of NLP. NLP englobes all techniques used for parsing text and extracting some knowledge about it. It could be finding out what are the common entities in the text, calculating the likelihood of a certain word being a preposition or a verb, sentiment analysis, or even spell checking sentences.</p>
<div class='row'>

<a  href="/2017/06/03/natural-language-processing-and-natural-language-understanding/nlp-nlu.png" rel="prettyPhoto" class="thumbnail" title="NLP, NLU, and NLG">
<img style="height: 400px;" class="ui image" src="/2017/06/03/natural-language-processing-and-natural-language-understanding/nlp-nlu.png" alt="NLP, NLU, and NLG" />

<figcaption>NLP, NLU, and NLG &mdash; <i>source http://nlp.stanford.edu/~wcmac/papers/20140716-UNLU.pdf</i></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>When you are processing a language, it does not mean you are understanding the language. You may simply have rules, statistics, or some heuristics built to extract the information you need for some work.</p>
<p>NLU, on the other hand, implies that a system will try to understand the text. A text such as <em>&#8220;Given the price of mandarin lately, how likely is it to increase as much as the bananas?&#8221;</em>, could be parsed with NLP tools such as OpenNLP, CoreNLP, spaCy, etc.</p>
<p>However, you would have annotated text, entities, sentiment, perhaps coreference, but you still would not be able to build a machine that simply understands it. You can - with some effort - build rule based systems, apply semantics and ontologies, or use information retrieval techniques.</p>
<p>But it is still extremely hard to build a system to understand all the ways it could be said, slightly modified, such as <em>&#8220;are mandarins getting as expensive as bananas?&#8221;</em>, or take into consideration context information like localization or time <em>&#8220;were mandarins getting as expensive as bananas around the Pacific Islands five years ago?&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>There are other subfields in NLP, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation"><strong>Natural Language Generation</strong></a> (NLG). Techniques from both NLU and NLG are used in chat bots, to parse the language and also to generate text based on the conversation.</p>
<p>NLP is an extremely interesting topic. 2001: A Space Odissey, Star Trek, The Foundation Series, and other science fiction books and movies. These all have intelligente computer systems that interact with humans. But should we tried to re-create these right now, even with all the work on machine learning, we would still have very funny (and perhaps dangerous) results.</p>

    <title>Apache Commons Text LookupTranslator</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 02, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/06/02/apache-commons-text-lookuptranslator</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p><a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/">Apache Commons Text</a> includes several algorithms for text processing. Today&#8217;s post is about one of the classes available since the 1.0 release, the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/translate/LookupTranslator.html">LookupTranslator</a>.</p>
<p>It is used to translate text using a lookup table. Most users won&#8217;t necessarily be - knowingly - using this class. Most likely, they will use the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/StringEscapeUtils.html">StringEscapeUtils</a>, which contains methods to escape and unescape CSV, JSON, XML, Java, and EcmaScript.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">original</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;He didn&#39;t say, \&quot;stop!\&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;He didn&#39;t say, \\\&quot;stop!\\\&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">result</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StringEscapeUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">escapeJava</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">original</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>StringEscapeUtils uses CharSequenceTranslator&#8217;s, including LookupTranslator. You can use it directly too, to escape other data your text may contain, special characters not supported by some third party library or system, or even a simpler case.</p>
<p>In other words, you would be creating your own StringEscapeUtils. Let&#8217;s say you have some text where numbers must never start with the zero digital, due to some restriction in the way you use that data later.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Map</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">lookupTable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">HashMap</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;();</span>
<span class="n">lookupTable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">LookupTranslator</span> <span class="n">escapeNumber0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">LookupTranslator</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">[][]</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="s">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">});</span>
<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">escaped</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">escapeNumber0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">translate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;There are 02 texts waiting for analysis today...&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>That way the resulting text would be &#8220;There are 2 texts waiting for analysis today&#8221;, allowing you to proceed with the rest of your analysis. This is a very simple example, but hopefully you grokked how LookupTranslator works.</p>

    <title>When you don't realize you need a Comparable</title>
    <pubDate>May 15, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/05/15/when-you-dont-realize-you-need-a-comparable</link>

    <description><p><a href="/2012/10/20/replacing-a-hashset-with-a-bitset">In 2012, I wrote</a> about how you always learn something new by following the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html">Apache dev mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p>After about five years, I am still learning, and still getting impressed by the knowledge of other
developers. Days ago I was massaging some code in <a href="https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/237">a pull request</a>
and a developer suggested me to simplify my code.</p>
<p>The suggestion was to make a class a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html">Comparable type</a>
to both simplify the code, and also have a better design. I immediately agreed, and looking back in hindsight,
it was the most logical choice. Yet, I simply did not think about that.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// What the code was</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">VSPACE_SORTKEY</span> <span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">cmp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">c1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">nv1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCollation</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">c2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">nv2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCollation</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">c1</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">null</span> 
        <span class="n">Collator</span> <span class="n">collator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Collator</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getInstance</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">desiredLocale</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="n">cmp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">collator</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">compare</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">nv1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getString</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="n">nv2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getString</span><span class="o">());</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">cmp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">XSDFuncOp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">compareString</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">nv1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">nv2</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">cmp</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// What the code is now</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">VSPACE_SORTKEY</span> <span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">((</span><span class="n">NodeValueSortKey</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">nv1</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">compareTo</span><span class="o">((</span><span class="n">NodeValueSortKey</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">nv2</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This moved the logic to a method in the <code>NodeValueSortKey</code> class. This reduced the complexity
of the class with the <code>switch</code> statement. And it also made it easier to write unit tests.</p>
<p>If you are not involved in Open Source projects yet, I keep my suggestion from five years ago.
Find a project related to something you like, and start reading the code, lurk in the
mailing list or watch GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>You can always learn more!</p>

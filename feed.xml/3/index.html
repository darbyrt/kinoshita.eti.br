    <title>Contributing to Krita</title>

    <description><p>As I mentioned in the <a href="/2017/01/02/debugging-an-application-that-freezes-the-x-server">last post</a>, I have been learning Qt and using C and C++ again.
Since I used C and C++ more during university (about 10 years ago, phew), decided
to read real code.</p>
<p>I used Photoshop, Illustrator, and Fireworks a lot when I was younger and had more
time to spend drawing. But some time ago I switched to Inkscape for vector graphics,
which I use at work for presentations. So it was only natural to try Krita now.</p>
<p>Since I was going to try Krita, I thought why not check out and build from source, and then
in case I found any bugs, contribute back? Or maybe from time to time triage issues,
find low hanging ones, and send a patch?</p>
<p>Well, turns out the Krita project has a great community, and it is super easy to send
contributions. So far I submitted three patches, some were included in 3.x releases.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366741">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366741</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=364208">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=364208</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=374451">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=374451</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While the patches are rather small, they are suggestions on how to fix memory
segmentation faults, or strange behaviours in the interface. For these issues,
I had to learn more about Qt components, signals and emitting events, and,
of course, work with pointers, arrays, Qt data structures, etc. In other words,
lots of (geek) fun!</p>
<p>In other words, by contributing to Krita, I am not only helping the project
and giving a little back to the community, but also refreshing my memory on
C and C++, and slowly learning Qt - which is not very hard if you worked with
Swing/AWT, Delphi, Visual Basic, Gtk, etc.</p>
<p>What are you waiting to contribute to Krita? The developers that maintain the
project answer tickets and questions posted to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/krita">reddit</a>
in a good time, and are extremely easy to work with.</p>
<p>Read more <a href="http://www.davidrevoy.com/article193/guide-building-krita-on-linux-for-cats">here</a> how to build from source, and
<a href="https://krita.org/en/get-involved/developers/">here</a> on how to submit patches.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p></description>

    <title>Debugging an application that freezes the X server</title>
    <pubDate>Jan 02, 2017</pubDate>
    <link>/2017/01/02/debugging-an-application-that-freezes-the-x-server</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Some time ago, I decided to start writing C++ again, and picked Krita for that.
Krita is written in C++ and Qt. The <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366741">bug I was working on</a>
involved a memory issue when changing the UI.</p>
<p>The problem was that this UI change would result in, not only Krita, but the whole
X server freezing. My set up was basically Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, with Eclipse, Qt5,
and the latest version of Krita checked out via git.</p>
<p>Initially I spent some time looking at the logs, tracing the binary, even downloaded
some Qt utility tools to look at the events and what was happening with the application
when it froze.</p>
<p>However, eventually I realized I was going to spend more time on this part of the
issue, rather than on the memory bug. So decided to look for a work-around.</p>
<p>Thankfully someone else blogged about a similar issue and saved me a lot of time :-)
Here&#8217;s how I did it, following the instructions in
<a href="http://www.geany.org/manual/gtk/gtk-faq/x462.html">this blog post</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install xnest -y
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>krita_install/
<span class="nv">$ </span>Xnest :10
<span class="nv">$ </span>twm -display :10
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">DISPLAY</span><span class="o">=</span>:10
<span class="nv">$ </span>./krita
</pre></div>

<p>That&#8217;s it. You should have Krita running in a separate window, with Xnest, and within
this window the twm window manager running. So when it freezes, at least you can still
debug your application in Eclipse or whatever IDE you prefer.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p></description>

    <title>PermGen errors and java.lang.ClassCastException: com.sun.crypto.provider.AESCipher cannot be cast to javax.crypto.CipherSpi running Jenkins plug-in tests with PowerMock</title>
    <pubDate>Dec 19, 2016</pubDate>
    <link>/2016/12/19/permgen-errors-and-java-lang-classcastexception-com-sun-crypto-provider-aescipher-cannot-be-cast-to-javax-crypto-cipherspi-running-jenkins-plug-in-tests-with-powermock</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Recently while working on a Jenkins plugin some tests were failing with PermGen errors.
Even though it worked in my notebook at home (with Java 8, thus no Permgen), it failed
in a CloudBees hosted Jenkins job, and also on my Mac (with Java 7) at work.</p>
<p>As I could not change the settings in the CloudBees hosted Jenkins, I decided to spent some
time investigating why these tests would require so much memory. Then I found
<a href="https://angus.nyc/2015/fixing-common-powermock-problems/">this blog post about PowerMock</a>.</p>
<p>I was not using the <em>@PrepareForTest</em> annotation, but after adding it the issue was gone. So I
assume it either prevents PowerMock from trying to dynamically load several classes, or instructs
it to unload classes after the tests. But in anyway after adding it the issue was gone.</p>
<p>Then I got the following exception.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>WARNING: Failed to instantiate Key<span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="o">=</span>hudson.security.csrf.DefaultCrumbIssuer<span class="nv">$DescriptorImpl</span>, <span class="nv">annotation</span><span class="o">=[</span>none<span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> skipping this component

</pre></div>

<p>And then thanks to <a href="https://github.com/powermock/powermock/issues/294">this issue</a> I understood
that PowerMock was mocking <em>javax.crypto</em> classes. Turns out it is quite easy to tell
PowerMock to ignore certain classes from being mocked, with the <em>@PowerMockIgnore</em> annotation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// snip</span>
<span class="nd">@RunWith</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">PowerMockRunner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">)</span>

<span class="c1">//</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
<span class="c1">// snip</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Added a couple of notes to this <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Mocking+in+Unit+Tests">Jenkins Wiki page</a>
so that users facing similar issues can try these possible workarounds.</p>
<p>Hope that helps someone!</p></description>

    <title>Using Requests Session Objects for web scraping</title>
    <pubDate>Nov 25, 2016</pubDate>
    <link>/2016/11/25/using-requests-session-objects-for-web-scraping</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>I had to write a Python script some months ago, that would retrieve Solar energy
data from a web site. It was basically a handful of HTTP calls, parse the response
that was mainly in JSON, and store the results as JSON and CSV for processing later.</p>
<p>Since it was such a small task, I used the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org">Requests</a>
module instead of a complete web scraper. The HTTP requests had to be made with a
time out, and also pass certain headers. I started customizing each call, until
I learned about the Requests <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/">Session Objects</a>.</p>
<p>You create a session, as in ORM/JPA, where you can define a context, with certain properties
and control an orthogonal behavior.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>

<p>Besides the session object, that gives you ability to add headers to all requests,
you won&#8217;t have to worry about redirects. The library by default takes care
<a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/dfad00a6e84bc75b12468ca29ccf4f971c813fc8/requests/sessions.py#L110">of that</a>
with a <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/dfad00a6e84bc75b12468ca29ccf4f971c813fc8/requests/models.py#L54">default limit of up to 30</a>.</p>

    <title>Changing Spring Boot environment variables in the command line</title>
    <pubDate>Nov 21, 2016</pubDate>
    <link>/2016/11/21/changing-spring-boot-environment-variables-in-the-command-line-</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>This week while helping developers and testers to experiment with a backend application,
some of them found useful to learn a simple trick to change Spring Boot properties
when you can run the application locally (our testers build, compile, change the code, how cool
is that?).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works. Say you have the following settings in your application&#8217;s
<strong>application.properties</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>my.application.database.username<span class="o">=</span>sa
my.application.database.password<span class="o">=</span>notasimplepassword
</pre></div>

<p>And that you want to change these parameters in order to, for instance, create an application
error, so that you can code and test what happens to the frontend application in that situation.</p>
<p>You replace <em>dots</em> by <em>underscores</em>, and put all your words in upper case. So the variables
above would be: MY_APPLICATION_DATABASE_USERNAME and MY_APPLICATION_DATABASE_PASSWORD.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you do not need to edit your application.properties file, if you are on Linux or
Mac OS. You can start the application and override environment variables at the same time
with the following syntax.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ MY_APPLICATION_DATABASE_USERNAME</span><span class="o">=</span>olivei <span class="nv">MY_APPLICATION_DATABASE_PASSWORD</span><span class="o">=</span>7655432222a mvn clean spring-boot:run
</pre></div>

<p>This way your application will start with the new values.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;EDIT&#8212;</strong></p>
<p>As pointed by Stéphane Nicoll (thanks!), you could change the property values
without having to use the upper case syntax.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>mvn -Dmy.application.database.username<span class="o">=</span>anotheruser clean spring-boot:run
</pre></div>

<p>And he even included a link to <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config">docs</a>! ♥ the Internet and Open Source!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinow">@kinow</a> you can also specify them as command-line arguments (no need for the upper case thing)<a href="https://t.co/zBKpgcXN1C">https://t.co/zBKpgcXN1C</a><br><br>or `-Drun.arguments`</p>&mdash; Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) <a href="https://twitter.com/snicoll/status/800965565120708608">November 22, 2016</a></blockquote>

    <title>Add a header to a file with Shell script (sed)</title>
    <pubDate>Nov 12, 2016</pubDate>
    <link>/2016/11/12/add-a-header-to-a-file-with-shell-script-sed</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Today I was re-generating the documentation for a REST API written in PHP, with
Laravel. To generate the documentation, one would have to call a Laravel command first.
That command would create a Markdown page. And since in this project I am using Jekyll
for the project site, the final step was adding a header to the file, so that Jekyll
can recognize that content as a blog post.</p>
<p>Laravel allows you to add custom commands to your project, so I decided to write a command
that would call the other command that generates the documentation, and add an extra step
of adding the header to the Markdown file.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the shell script part, that allows you to add a header to a file, in place (i.e.
it will alter and save the change your file).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sed -i 1i<span class="s2">&quot;----\nlayout: page\ntitle: API Installation\n----\n\n&quot;</span> ./docs/documentation/api/api.md
</pre></div>

<p>Here the first argument to sed, <em>-i</em> is for in place. Then that strange <em>1i</em>
means that it will insert something before the first line, once. Then we have our header,
and finally the file.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p></description>

    <title>Content negotiation with Spring Boot and React</title>
    <pubDate>Nov 07, 2016</pubDate>
    <link>/2016/11/07/content-negotiation-with-spring-boot-and-react</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>A few days ago I had a bug in a system built with Spring Boot and React. The frontend application
was using a REST client in React, built in a similar way to what is found in the documentation, and
also in blogs.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nx">rest</span> <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rest&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">Rest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">rest</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">wrap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">mime</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>However, for one of the Spring Boot application endpoints, the React component was not working. The
response seemed to be OK in the Network tab, of the browser developer tools. But the component was
failing and complaining when parsing the response.</p>
<p>Turns out that the frontend was sending the request with the header <code>Accept: text/plain, application/json</code>.
And Spring Boot was just using its <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2013/05/11/content-negotiation-using-spring-mvc">default content negotiation</a>
and returning what the frontend requested: a text plain version of, what looked like, JSON.</p>
<p>The quick fix was to request the content as JSON in React.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nx">rest</span> <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rest&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nx">mime</span> <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rest/interceptor/mime&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">Rest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">rest</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">wrap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">mime</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">mime</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;application/json&#39;</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now we will revisit the backend to return the JSON content, as content, regardless of what
the user asks :-)</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p></description>

    <title>Checking the operating system type in shell script</title>
    <pubDate>Nov 05, 2016</pubDate>
    <link>/2016/11/05/checking-the-operating-system-type-in-shell-script</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Last week I learned about a tool called <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck">ShellCheck</a>, a tool
for static analysis of shell scripts. It reports errors like missing double quotes, use of deprecated
syntax, etc.</p>
<p>I decided to check some projects I contribute to, and the first issue I found was in
<a href="https://jena.apache.org">Apache Jena</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>kinow@localhost:~/Development/java/jena/jena/apache-jena/bin<span class="nv">$ </span>shellcheck arq

In arq line 8:
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$OSTYPE</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> in
          ^-- SC2039: In POSIX sh, OSTYPE is not supported.
</pre></div>

<p>So, in summary, the <code>OSTYPE</code> variable should not be available in POSIX shell. The case in question, where
<code>OSTYPE</code> is being used, checks for the Darwin OS type (i.e. Mac OS). Knowing how things get weird when you
use different operating systems, I decided to check and learn how <code>OSTYPE</code> works. Here&#8217;s what I found.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Ubuntu, with /bin/bash, OSTYPE works fine (linux-gnu)</li>
<li>In Ubuntu, with /bin/sh, OSTYPE is not set</li>
<li>In Mac OS, with /bin/sh, OSTYPE is set (darwin15)</li>
</ul>
<p>I checked the shells to make sure they were not pointing to symbolic links - some distributions
use a different default shell, and replace /bin/bash and/or /bin/sh by a link to another
shell. Looks like Mac OS has a POSIX shell that behaves different than Ubuntu&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to find a way to use <code>OSTYPE</code>, I decided to spend some time looking at
how other projects do the same thing. And the best example I could find was
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/config.mak.uname">git</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on <code>OSTYPE</code>, git uses <code>uname</code>.</p>
<p>I will spend some time during the next days working on a proposal to replace the <code>OSTYPE</code>
from Apache Jena scripts, but then may have to submit more changes for the other issues
found by ShellCheck.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p></description>

    <description><p>Amazon Web Services provides a series of cloud services. When you access the web interface, most - if not all - of the actions you do there are actually translated into API calls.</p>
<p>They also provide SDK&#8217;s in several programming languages. With these SDK&#8217;s you are able to call the same API used by the web interface. Python has <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3">boto</a> (or boto3) which lets you to automate several tasks in AWS.</p>
<p>But before you start using the API, you will need to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160818112016/http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html">set up your access key</a>.</p>
<p>It is likely that with time you will have different roles, and may have different permissions with each role. You have to configure your local environment so that you can either use the command line Python utility (installed via <code>pip install awscli</code>) or with boto.</p>
<p>The awscli is a dependency for using boto3. After you install it, you need to run <code>aws configure</code>. It will create the <em>~/.aws/config</em> and <em>~/.aws/credentials</em> files. You can tweak these files to support multiple roles.</p>
<p>I followed the tutorials, but got all sorts of different issues. Then after debugging some locally installed dependencies, in special awscli files, I found that the following settings work for my environment.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># File: config</span>
<span class="o">[</span>profile default<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nv">region</span> <span class="o">=</span> ap-southeast-2

<span class="o">[</span>profile profile1<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nv">region</span> <span class="o">=</span> ap-southeast-2
<span class="nv">source_profile</span> <span class="o">=</span> default
<span class="nv">role_arn</span> <span class="o">=</span> arn:aws:iam::123:role/Developer

<span class="o">[</span>profile profile2<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nv">region</span> <span class="o">=</span> ap-southeast-2
<span class="nv">source_profile</span> <span class="o">=</span> default
<span class="nv">role_arn</span> <span class="o">=</span> arn:aws:iam::456:role/Sysops
<span class="nv">mfa_serial</span> <span class="o">=</span> arn:aws:iam::789:mfa/user@domain.blabla
</pre></div>

<p>and</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># File: credentials</span>
<span class="o">[</span>default<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nv">aws_access_key_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> YOU_KEY_ID
<span class="nv">aws_secret_access_key</span> <span class="o">=</span> YOUR_SECRET
</pre></div>

<p>And once it is done you can, for example, confirm it is working with some S3 commands in Python.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env python3</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

</pre></div>

<p>The AWS files in this example are using MFA too, the multi-factor authentication. So the first time you run this code you may be asked to generate a token, which will be cached for a short time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p></description>

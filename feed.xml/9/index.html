    <description><p>Tis&#8217; the end of 2011! Yay! Throughout this year I&#8217;ve heard people repeatedly saying that I had too much on my plate, and that I should quit some projects, stop giving talks, start surfing again amongst other things. Now, looking back, although I&#8217;m quite happy with my achievements in 2011, I can see their point.</p>
<p>In 2010 I started working as Software Quality Engineer with <a title="Anderson Santos" href="http://andersonxp.tumblr.com/">Anderson Santos</a>. He was the greatest supporter of many of my ideas, so although we stopped working together in 2011, I&#8217;m still grateful to him for all he taught, for his advices and for spending some time guiding me.</p>
<p>He motivated me to start giving talks, going to more conferences and contributing more actively to Open Source projects. Since then, I&#8217;ve given almost 10 talks, including one in <a title="Belgium Testing Days" href="http://www.belgiumtestingdays.com">Belgium Testing Days</a>, another one in<a title="Oracle JavaOne" href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/lad-pt/"> Oracle JavaOne</a> and in March next year I will be in America for a talk in <a title="STP Con" href="http://www.stpcon.com/">STPCON</a>. I also missed <a title="JCertif" href="http://www.jcertif.com">JCertif</a> conference in Congo due to visa problems and learned some lessons from it (so sorry Max :)</p>

    <title>Practical test doubles: adding stubs to TestLink Java API</title>
    <pubDate>Oct 23, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/10/23/practical-test-doubles-adding-stubs-to-testlink-java-api</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p><em>&#8220;<strong>Test Double</strong> is a generic term for any case where you replace a production object for testing purposes&#8221;</em> [<a href="#1">1</a>]. There are different types of Test Doubles: <strong>Dummy</strong>, <strong>Fake</strong>, <strong>Stubs</strong>, <strong>Spies</strong> and <strong>Mocks</strong>. In this post we will see a practical example of adding stubs to <a href="testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net" title="TestLink Java API">TestLink Java API</a>.</p>

<p>Stubs are objects that return canned answers to calls during tests [1]. This is useful specially when you have a system that communicates with different resources such as databases, web services, XML-RPC services and so on.</p>

<p>TestLink Java API is a small Java project created to act as an interface between <a href="http://www.teamst.org" title="TestLink">TestLink</a> XML-RPC API and a client program written in Java.</p>

    <title>Building Jenkins with Eclipse and m2e plug-in</title>
    <pubDate>Sep 20, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/09/20/building-jenkins-with-eclipse-and-m2e-plug-in</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Yesterday I finally managed to build <a title="Jenkins" href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> using <a title="Eclipse" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and <a title="m2e plug-in" href="http://eclipse.org/m2e/">m2e plug-in</a>. With <a title="Eclipse Indigo" href="http://www.eclipse.org/indigo">Eclipse Indigo</a> release came a new version of the <a title="Maven" href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> plug-in for Eclipse (former <a title="M2Eclipse" href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/">M2Eclipse</a>), m2e. Since I started using Eclipse Indigo and this new plug-in I hadn&#8217;t been able to build Jenkins in Eclipse anymore.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been having a terrible fever and thought that it would be a good thing to stop playing <a href="http://www.minecraft.net" title="Minecraft">Minecraft</a> for a while and find a way to build Jenkins in Eclipse + m2e :-).</p>

<h2>1. Maven Plug-ins execution in project life cycle</h2>

<p>The first thing I&#8217;ve noticed were the messages regarding the execution of some Maven plug-ins in the project life cycle. m2e delegates the execution of Maven plug-ins to an external executor. As not all Maven plug-ins have an existing executor for m2e you will receive a message similar to &#8220;Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: &#8230;&#8221;.</p>

    <title>Missed JCertif</title>
    <pubDate>Sep 07, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/09/07/missed-jcertif</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Unfortunately I missed JCertif last weekend. My visa was in Brazzaville but I couldn&#8217;t board in a flight from Johannesburg to Congo without it. Max Bonbhel kindly tried to fax me the visa, but the last flight to Congo closed and I had to come back to Brazil sooner. :-(</p>

<p>Here is the slides that I was going to use there. Hope you take some time to read about TAP, SubUnit and other test protocols. There are two special points to pay attention to, one single format and extensibility.</p>

<p  style=" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;">   <a title="View Jcertif 2011 Tap on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/64127001/Jcertif-2011-Tap"  style="text-decoration: underline;" >Jcertif 2011 Tap</a> by <a title="View brunodepaulak's profile on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/brunodepaulak"  style="text-decoration: underline;" >brunodepaulak</a></p>

<iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="http://www.scribd.com/embeds/64127001/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-bxtrnpq41waa1g8dc4a&show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="1.5" scrolling="no" id="doc_39777" width="640px" height="480px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>With a single format for your test results, you won&#8217;t need to write many different parsers, one for each distinct format. Extensibility refers to the fact that using formats like xUnit (like JUnit) or TestNG XML you are limited to the XML schema.</p>

<p>Many projects are aiming automation in different levels. Executing automated tests can lead to situations where you need to have information like the database used, JDK version, screen shots taken during some tests, exception stack traces, etc. TAP and SubUnit provide manners to extend your test result and inform to a test consumer (the tool that reads your test output) about such information.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p></description>

    <title>TDC 2011 Floripa presentation about running your tests in Jenkins</title>
    <pubDate>Aug 25, 2011</pubDate>

    <description><p>Last weekend I attended TDC (<a title="The Developers Conference" href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br">The Developers Conference</a>) 2011 in Florian&oacute;polis, in the south of Brazil. It was my first time in Florian&oacute;polis, but the weather was cloudy and cold, so I couldn&#8217;t check out one of the prettiest cities in Brazil :-( Bummer.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="The Developers Conference" href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793" title="banner-TDC2011-180x36" src="/2011/08/25/tdc-2011-floripa-presentation-about-running-your-tests-in-jenkins/banner_TDC2011_floripapng" alt="" width="180" height="36" /></a></p>

<p>Putting the weather aside, TDC was great! Basically, there were many nice, easy-going people gathering together to talk about subjects like Java, SOA, Arduino, Testing, Agile and more. I had the chance to talk with skilled and experienced people, see different talks and catch up Guilherme Motta (<a title="@gfcmotta" href="http://www.twitter.com/gfcmotta">@gfcmotta</a>) from <a title="ThoughtWorks" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, who I have met in Porto Alegre in the beginning of this year. He gave an interesting talk about crowd testing using games as example, but varying with applications in different areas too.</p>

    <title>Bug hunting, new job and preparing presentations</title>
    <pubDate>Aug 13, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/08/13/bug-hunting-new-job-and-preparing-presentations</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>It&#8217;s been a while since the last time I posted something here. The reason is that I have been busy fixing bugs in <a title="Jenkins TestLink Plug-in" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin">Jenkins TestLink Plug-in</a>, <a title="TestLink" href="http://www.teamst.org">TestLink</a>, <a title="TestLink Java API" href="http://testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net/">TestLink Java API</a>, <a title="tap4j" href="http://www.tap4j.org">tap4j</a>, <a title="Jenkins TAP Plug-in" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin">Jenkins TAP Plug-in</a> and other Open Source projects.</p>
<p>Recently I left <a title="Sysmap Solutions" href="http://www.sysmap.com.br">Sysmap Solutions</a>, where I was a consultant, to have my labor card signed by <a title="Lojas Riachuelo" href="http://www.lojasriachuelo.com.br">Lojas Riachuelo</a>, a famous Brazilian fashion retailer (like C&amp;A, Zara, H&amp;M and so on), part of Guararapes group.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lojasriachuelo.com.br" title="Lojas Riachuelo"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-781" title="riachuelo" src="/2011/08/13/bug-hunting-new-job-and-preparing-presentations/riachuelo.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="125" /></a></p>

<p>So I am still getting used to the new routine, new systems and be a employee rather than a consultant.</p>
<p>There are also two talks to come, one in a few days at <a title="The Developers Conferecen" href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br">TDC</a> (The Developers Conference) 2011 in Florian&oacute;polis, and another one in the beginning of September at <a title="JCertif" href="http://www.jcertif.com">JCertif</a> in Congo/Brazzaville. While I already bought the tickets and booked the hotel rooms, I still have to finish some slides and practical examples for both events.</p>
<p>I already have two draft posts that I am still writing. One about continuous integration and parallelism/concurrency, and another one about spell check in DocBook projects, specially if you are using Maven.</p>
<p>Today I had a new idea for a bioinformatics tool that is may be helpful for researchers and bioinformatics professionals. I will write about it as soon as I find some spare time, so stay tuned ;)</p>
<p>Time to get back to work!</p>
<p>Cheers</p></description>

    <title>Why am I learning Perl? </title>
    <pubDate>Jun 15, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/06/15/why-am-i-learning-perl</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Last month I attended the <a title="II Sao Paulo Perl Workshop" href="http://www.perlworkshop.com.br">II Sao Paulo Perl Workshop</a>, where I had the privilege of learning with the great talks performed by <a title="Bryan D Foy" href="http://www252.pair.com/~comdog/">bryan d foy</a>, <a title="Brad FitzPatrick" href="http://bradfitz.com/">Brad FitzPatrick</a> and <a title="Larry Wall" href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/">Larry Wall</a>. For being a Java programmer, you can imagine how lost I was feeling there.</p>
<p>The first programming language that I had contact with was Perl. I was a 16 years old <a title="Slackware Linux" href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a> aficionado at that time, and was dying to have a web site with a guestbook . We did not have any cheap hosting services in Brazil that offered a <a title="PHP" href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> environment, but there were few companies that offered a free host with ads, and with Perl. I don&#8217;t remember which script I used, only that I found it in <a title="HotScripts.com" href="http://www.hotscripts.com">HotScripts.com</a> and that it stored the guestbook entries in disk. Now, ten years after, here I am playing with Perl again! :-D
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/06/15/why-am-i-learning-perl/larry_wall.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-740" title="Bruno and Larry @ II Sao Paulo Perl Workshop" src="/2011/06/15/why-am-i-learning-perl/larry_wall.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></a></p>
Well, what was my idea of Perl before the event? I thought it was an old programming language, very powerful, but over complicated. And what do I think of Perl now? I think it is an old programming language, very powerful, but may be complicated.</p>

    <title>A comparison of TAP (Test Anything Protocol) and SubUnit</title>
    <pubDate>Jun 04, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/06/04/a-comparison-of-tap-test-anything-protocol-and-subunit</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>
    I have been playing with <a href="http://www.testanything.org">TAP</a> for some time and even implemented a <a
        href="http://www.tap4j.org">Java API</a> to let <a href="http://www.testng.org">TestNG</a>, <a
        href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> and other Test Frameworks to produce and consume TAP. TAP is a standard
    format for test output that first appeared with Perl 1 in 1987. It is human and machine readable, easy to be
    serialized, language independent and extensible<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> through the use of <a
        href="http://www.yaml.org">YAML</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Some days ago while I was designing a plug-in to show TAP test results in <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a>
    I stumbled across a message in <a href="http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html">Jenkins
        dev-list</a> where Max Magee and Nick Wiesmueller were discussing about a way of showing more details about the test
    executions. I thought that the TAP Plug-in would fit perfectly, until one of the users, <a
        href="https://launchpad.net/~lifeless">Robert Collins</a>, mentioned <a href="https://launchpad.net/subunit">SubUnit</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Shame on me, but I hadn&#8217;t heard of SubUnit until that message. Max Magee and I exchanged some messages after that,
    talking about a initial design and analysis for the TAP Plug-in<sup>

<a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Here is the initial
    idea:
<p>
<ul>
    <li>The plug-in will be able to parse one or more test formats (maybe SubUnit, TAP and the formats available in
        xUnit?).</li>
    <li>The test results will be displayed the same way JUnit tests are displayed in Jenkins (I think Jenkins
        supports JUnit format by default, but you can use objects and create test results data, independently of the
        test framework that you are using).</li>
    <li>There will be a table containing the Test Name, Description and Status and an expandable section.</li>
    <li>Inside this expandable section will be available all the details about the test.</li>
    <li>In case there are images within the test details, they should be displayed as a lightbox gallery.<sup><a
            href="#3">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Although I have worked with TAP and spent some good time writing the tap4j port for Java, I am not convinced it is
    the best solution for this issue yet. Hence I am posting this initial comparison between TAP and SubUnit hoping that
    more people will contribute with the design of this solution. My goal is not only having a super cool plug-in for
    Jenkins, but ease integration of test results in different tools and collaborate with both TAP and SubUnit. Another
    objective that I have in mind is improving the way that test results are displayed in Jenkins and enabling it to be
    an alternative for tools like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smolder/">Smolder</a>, <a
        href="https://launchpad.net/testrepository">TestRepository</a> or <a href="https://launchpad.net/tribunal">Tribunal</a>.
    Because I believe the tasks done by these tools could be all done in my favorite CI Server, and it would increase
    the productivity of Build &amp; Release professionals :-))

    <title>Fa√ßa seus Testes Falarem TAP (Make your Tests Speak TAP) article published in MundoJ, issue 47, March/April 2011</title>
    <pubDate>May 23, 2011</pubDate>
    <link>/2011/05/23/faca-seus-testes-falarem-tap-make-your-tests-speak-tap-article-published-in-mundoj-issue-47-marchapril-2011</link>

    <description><p>This is my first article for a Brazilian magazine! :-D It was published in this month&#8217;s issue of <a href="http://www.mundoj.com.br">MundoJ</a> magazine (previously called MundoJava).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/05/23/faca-seus-testes-falarem-tap-make-your-tests-speak-tap-article-published-in-mundoj-issue-47-marchapril-2011/ed47p.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-659 center" title="MundoJ issue 47" src="/2011/05/23/faca-seus-testes-falarem-tap-make-your-tests-speak-tap-article-published-in-mundoj-issue-47-marchapril-2011/ed47p.jpg" alt="" width="99" height="130" /></a></p>

<p>In this article Cesar Fernandes de Almeida, <a href="http://andersonxp.tumblr.com/">Anderson dos Santos</a> and I discuss how to make your Java tests output <a href="http://www.testanything.org">TAP</a> (Test Anything Protocol) Streams. This test protocol has been used by Perl developers since Perl&#8217;s first version (1983~) but hasn&#8217;t been used by many Java developers yet, unfortunately. We hope it incentives other Java developers to use TAP for their tests. There is an alternative to TAP too, <a href="https://launchpad.net/subunit">SubUnit</a>, which was pointed out for me by <a href="https://launchpad.net/~lifeless">Robert Collins</a> in the <a href="http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html">Jenkins dev-list</a> few weeks ago. Now I am preparing a comparison between TAP and SubUnit as an analysis before developing a plug-in for Jenkins to show detailed test results (such as exception, images, raw test, error line, etc). </p>
<p>Throughout the article we explain how to use <a href="http://www.tap4j.org">tap4j</a> to generate TAP Streams with <a href="http://www.testng.org">TestNG</a>, however it is possible to use the same approach to generate TAP Streams with <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.</p>
<p>Now I will translate the article to send it to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~patl/">Patrick LeBoutillier</a>, who contributed to this article answering patiently my questions by mail and writing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~patl/metatap-0.01/">metatap</a>, a utility that lets you check if a TAP Stream is valid, according to the program parameters. This utility is being used in tap4j for integration tests between Perl and Java.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I&#8217;m not allowed to redistribute the article, not even an English version of it :-(</p>
<p>Cheers :)</p></description>

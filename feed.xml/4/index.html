    <description><p>Few days ago we had <a href="http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/">SugarLoafPlop 2012</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com.br/maps?q=natal+-+rn&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=-23.682803,-46.595546&amp;sspn=0.653971,1.352692&amp;hnear=Natal+-+Rio+Grande+do+Norte&amp;t=m&amp;z=11">Natal - RN</a> </p>
<p>It is a conference on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language" title="Pattern Language">pattern languages</a> of programming. About six months ago I saw a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/emguerra" title="Eduardo Guerra">Eduardo Guerra</a> asking if anyone had some cases where certain patterns were applied. It was a big coincidence, since I was working on <a href="http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/functor/" title="Apache Commons Functor">Apache Commons Functor</a> and some <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins-CI">Jenkins plugins</a>, both projects with cases that could be used in his paper.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/"><img src="/2012/09/25/paper-patterns-for-introducing-a-superclass-for-test-classes/sugarloaf2012_300_146.jpg" alt="" title="SugarLoaf Plop 2012" width="300" height="146" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1071" /></a>

So I joined Guerra and gave my small contribution to the paper that <a href="http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/pages/acceptedpapers.html" title="accepted papers">has been accepted</a> for this edition of SugarLoafPlop. Guerra also went there to give a talk and participate in an open discussion about several papers, including ours.

I simply love when these things happen, it was great work with Guerra, and even better for being able to use Open Source examples in our paper.</description>

    <link>/2012/09/25/bioinformatic-tools-series-stacks</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>It is the first post about <strong>bioinformatics tools</strong>, but I will try to post more about other tools such as MrBayes, Structure, maybe some next generation sequencing tools too, and Bioperl, Biojava, and so on.</p>
<p>As I am more a computer geek, rather than a bioinformatics one, I will focus on requirements for running these tools on clusters and the requirements to install them on your machine. The instructions require that you have an intermediary knowledge on *nix OS and sometimes a bit of programming experience.</em></p></p>
<p><em>I will be using tutorials available on the Internet and hosting my code in <a href="http://www.github.com/kinow" alt="GitHub kinow" title="GitHub kinow">GitHub/kinow</a>. Hammer time!

    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Last weekend I spent some hours assembling old computer parts to create my commodity hardware cluster for running Hadoop. I already had a local installation in my notebook, so I thought it would be cool to run the word-count example in both scenarios to see what would be the results.</p>

<p>But first, let&#8217;s review the hardware configurations:</p>

    <title>Integrating Nutch 2.x, MySQL and Solr</title>
    <pubDate>Sep 14, 2012</pubDate>
    <link>/2012/09/14/integrating-nutch-2-x-mysql-and-solr</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>Right now we are working on a new project using <a href="http://nutch.apache.org" title="Apache Nutch">Apache Nutch</a> 2.x, <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org" title="Apache Hadoop">Apache Hadoop</a>, <a href="http://solr.apache.org" title="Apache Solr">Apache Solr</a> 4 and a lot of other cool tools/modules/API&#8217;s/etc. After following the instructions found on <a href="http://nlp.solutions.asia/?p=180" title="http://nlp.solutions.asia/?p=180">http://nlp.solutions.asia/?p=180</a>, I&#8217;ve successfully connected Apache Nutch, MySQL and Apache Solr.</p>

<p><img src="/2012/09/14/integrating-nutch-2-x-mysql-and-solr/mysql_hadoop_solr_nutch.png" alt="mysql_hadoop_solr_nutch" title="mysql_hadoop_solr_nutch" width="800" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-994" /></p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a database to hold your data</li>
<li>Use SQLDataStore and add configuration for your MySQL server</li>
<li>Update Apache Nutch configuration</li>
<li>Update Solr schema</li>
</ul>

<p>Now our Apache Nutch uses MySQL as data store (the place where it keeps the result of the crawling process, such as URL,  text content, metadata, and so on). That&#8217;s grand, but there is one part missing in the Solr Schema provided in the blog post.</p>

<p>Due to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-3432" title="SOLR-3432">SOLR-3432</a>, after following the tutorial and replacing the schema, we couldn&#8217;t delete the whole index anymore. After following the instructions in the bug comments, and adding the following entry in schema.xml it worked again.</p>

    <title>Invoking Testopia XML-RPC or JSON methods using Java</title>

    <description><p>Most <a href="http://www.teamst.org" title="TestLink">TestLink</a> [1] users are aware that there is an external API, maybe for the external API token being displayed in the user profile section. Today after a meeting with <a href="http://twitter.com/peterflorijn" title="Peter Florijn">Peter Florijn</a> [2], I realized that the same may not be true for <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/testopia/" title="Testopia">Testopia</a>  [3] users.</p>

<p>I am quite new to Testopia, and there are many features that I haven&#8217;t used yet. But if I understand it correctly, the database is interfaced by several Perl scripts that are, by its turns, exposed as Web Service (most of them). The web services are available via a JSON and a XML-RPC API (what is very useful, TestLink supports supports only XML-RPC).</p>

<p>The communication between different programming languages and the external API&#8217;s is accomplished by a client API. In TestLink you have <a href="http://testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net/" title="TestLink Java API">testlink-java-api</a> [4] and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/testlink-api-java-client/" title="TestLink API Java Client">testlink-api-java-client</a> [5].</p>

<p>Testopia has a Java client too, available in <a href="http://bzr.mozilla.org/bugzilla/extensions/testopia/2.2-bugzilla-3.2/files/head:/testopia/contrib/drivers/java/" title="Testopia source repository">Testopia source repository</a> [6] and can be used to integrate your existing Java code with Testopia.</p>

    <title>How I started in Open Source</title>
    <pubDate>Aug 08, 2012</pubDate>
    <link>/2012/08/08/how-i-started-in-open-source</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>I was studying at <a href="http://www.mackenzie.br" title="Mackenzie Presbyterian University">Mackenzie Presbyterian University</a> when I met <a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito" title="Rogerio Brito">Professor Rogerio Brito</a>. Most of my friends were terrified of him. Maybe because of the class name &#8220;<em>Structured Programming I</em>&#8220;. Or maybe because of what Brito taught us at class.</p>

<p>My degree was in computing, <em>Bachelor in System Information</em>. Although it is related to <em>Computer Science</em>, we don&#8217;t have the same classes. In Computer Science you have more math, statistics and even physics, while in System Information you have administration, strategic planning, law and others related to business.</p>

<p>Although Structured Programming had a list of topics, Brito didn&#8217;t limit himself to those. Eventually he would try to teach us about <em>algorithms</em>, <em>software complexity</em>, the importance of writing academic papers and explain about Open Source software.</p>

<p>I remember one day we were dismissed before 10PM. I used to run for the bus stop for not being too late at home and cause it could be dangerous lingering on the streets of Consolacao neighborhood by myself, waiting for the bus. But that day I stumbled with Brito near the Professor&#8217;s Room.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/2012/08/08/how-i-started-in-open-source/sensei_09.jpg" alt="" title="Itsuki Sensei - Moyashimon" width="250" height="141" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970" /></p>

<p>He invited me in. It was my first time in there. There were books and papers lying on the main table and in another part of the room there was a desktop computer. We started talking about programming and I can&#8217;t recall how but we ended up talking about Open Source. He showed me some websites and explained about a lot of nerd stuff.</p>

<p>I left the room after 11PM. Late for my bus and with a paper sheet. <em>A very important paper sheet</em>. It had a list of items to study, software to learn about and names that I had never heard before. One of the items of that list that I can still remember was &#8220;Reading about <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/" title="Open JDK">Open JDK</a>&#8221; (now being adopted over Oracle/Sun JDK). There was &#8220;Create a program for finding software bugs&#8221; too (like the famous <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/" title="FindBugs">FindBugs</a>).</p>

<p>He taught me about the basics of Open Source, gave me a list of interesting projects, explained how to join the project, where to look for information and how to assess the maturity and quality of a project. And also taught me more about <a href="http://www.usp.br" title="USP">USP</a> - University of Sao Paulo - and how to submit academic papers and what was a call for paper (when he said that word I translated it to Portuguese, you can imagine the confusion in my head) :-)</p>

<h2>He made me curious.</h2>

<p>This weekend I sent him an e-mail about analyzing the parallel execution of a software, using <a href="http://www.debian.org/" title="Debian">Debian</a>. He sent me a reply with some interesting links and a brief introduction about the topic. It&#8217;s starred at my inbox, while I look for some spare time to read his links and, certainly, learn something useful and interesting for any nerd.</p>

<p>Since that class, back in 2005, 2006, I&#8217;ve been involved in several Open Source projects, became an <a href="http://www.apache.org" title="Apache Software Foundation">Apache</a> Committer few days ago (I will write about this later) and I have created a company (<a href="http://www.tupilabs.com" title="TupiLabs">TupiLabs</a>) specialized in Open Source.</p>

<p>Thank you for lecturing me Brito, and thank you for not limiting your classes to the class planning. I believe that&#8217;s the best quality of a professor.</p>

<p>I wish all the success to you in your projects, and health to you and your family.</p></description>

    <title>Writing code to integrate Java projects to Testopia</title>
    <pubDate>May 18, 2012</pubDate>

    <description><p><em>Peter Florijn</em> and I are writing a <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins CI">Jenkins</a> plug-in to <em>integrate several test tools into Jenkins</em>, something similar to what is done in <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin" title="Jenkins TestLink Plug-in">TestLink plug-in</a>. It&#8217;s still an idea being explored, and the whole project is subjected to changes without warning. The code is at <a href="https://github.com/kinow/testthemall" title="https://github.com/kinow/testthemall">https://github.com/kinow/testthemall</a>.</p>
<p>The first tool that we are integrating is not <a href="http://www.teamst.org" title="TestLink">TestLink</a>, but <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/testopia/" title="Mozilla Testopia">Mozilla Testopia</a>. As part of the process to integrate these tools, many Java API&#8217;s to interface the existing external APIs will be created, like it was done in TestLink with <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/testlinkjavaapi/" title="TestLink Java API">TestLink Java API</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/2012/05/18/writing-coding-to-integrate-java-projects-to-testopia/Jenkins1_300_224.png" alt="" title="Jenkins CI" height="128" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-978" /><img src="/2012/05/18/writing-coding-to-integrate-java-projects-to-testopia/testopia_128_128.png" alt="" title="Testopia" width="128" height="128" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979" /></p>

<p>Installing Testopia is very easy and straightforward. <a href="http://blog.marcweigand.de/2011/02/20/how-to-setup-bugzilla-with-testopia-on-a-new-debian-squeeze-60/" title="http://blog.marcweigand.de/2011/02/20/how-to-setup-bugzilla-with-testopia-on-a-new-debian-squeeze-60/">This</a> was the best guide that I could find, and worked without errors at my Debian Squeeze. I only had to move the directories from <code>/var/www</code> to my home directory (I use my PHP Eclipse workspace as Apache home).</p>
<p>Testopia has a XML-RPC APi, just like TestLink, however it lacks an user friendly documentation and examples. I migrated the Java driver from Ant to Maven, for the sake of commodity. But the XML-RPC server is complaining that I have to log-in before listing the test cases of a test plan.</p>
<p>If you are interested in using Java and Testopia, here&#8217;s the link for the java project with Maven support: <a href="https://github.com/kinow/testopia-java-driver" title="https://github.com/kinow/testopia-java-driver">https://github.com/kinow/testopia-java-driver</a>. I will update the project with examples, more tests and will try to clean up the code. Probably I will use either GitHub pages or a Wiki somewhere to document how to use Testopia and Java. </p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p></description>

    <title>Maven site tips: Maven Fluido Skin and Javadoc class diagrams</title>
    <pubDate>Apr 06, 2012</pubDate>
    <link>/2012/04/06/maven-site-tips-maven-fluido-skin-and-javadoc-class-diagrams</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>I have been using Maven sites for a while, and am very happy with it. I didn&#8217;t like to have to update my projects after Maven 3, but that was all right, Maven 3 brought many new cool things. However, there were two things that annoyed me: lack of a nice and modern skin, and browsing Javadoc of complex code. The thought of creating a custom Maven skin even crossed my mind, but I never had time to read about it.</p>

<p>But the world is full of good and talented people! Like the guys from <a title="99soft" href="http://www.99soft.org/">99soft</a>. They created <a title="Maven Fluido Skin" href="http://maven.apache.org/skins/maven-fluido-skin/">Maven Fluido Skin</a>, and donated it to <a title="Apache Software Foundation" href="http://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>. It&#8217;s built on top of <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter&#8217;s Bootstrap</a> and available from Maven central repository. In order to use it in your Maven project, all that you have to do is add the following settings into your src/site/site.xml:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;skin&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.apache.maven.skins<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>maven-fluido-skin<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.2.1<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/skin&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here&#8217;s a list of some projects using Maven Fluido Skin (hopefully, in the near future <a title="Apache Commons" href="http://commons.apache.org/">Apache Commons</a> and other projects will adopt this skin as default too :-)):</p>

    <title>Ranges in Apache Commons Functor</title>
    <pubDate>Jan 22, 2012</pubDate>
    <link>/2012/01/22/ranges-in-apache-functor</link>
    <dc:creator></dc:creator>
    <description><p>This is a long post. So here is a <strong>TL;DR</strong>:
<ul>
    <li>Apache Commons Functor has no Double or Float Range (yet)</li>
    <li>Apache Commons Functor IntegerRange and LongRange treat the low value as inclusive, and the high value as exclusive. How does that compare to other languages/APIs? (you will have to read to see some comparison)</li>
    <li>Perl has support for characters ranges, perhaps we could implement it in Functor too?</li>
    <li>In case we implemented a CharacterRange, it would have to be inclusive for both low and high limits. With &#8216;z&#8217; being the last character, there wouldn&#8217;t have a way to include Z with the current approach. Or we would have to make the CharacterRange a special one. What would go against <a title="Liskov Substitution Principle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>.</li>
    <li>You can see a comparison table with Apache Commons Functor, other Java API&#8217;s and other programming languages for ranges clicking <a href="#ctable" title="Comparison table">here</a>.</li>
    <li>It would be nice to have a clear distinction in Functor documentation among a Sequence, a Generator and a Range. While I was gathering material for this post, I found places using range, others using sequence, and in Apache Commons Functor, an IntegerRange is a Generator.</li>
</ul>
Now, if you have some spare time or curiosity, keep reading :-)</p>

    <description><p>Definitely reading <a title="Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> before going to bed is a bad idea :-) Same goes for <a title="Reddit" href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>. So, I found a link about <a title="Bats" href="https://github.com/sstephenson/bats">Bats</a>, a tool to execute tests in Shell and output <a title="Test Anything Protocol" href="http://testanything.org">TAP</a> - Test Anything Protocol. Then I thought; why not ask the author to include Bats under the list of <a title="TAP Producers" href="http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/TAP_Producers#SH_.2F_Shell_Script">Producers</a> in <a title="Test Anything Protocol" href="http://testanything.org">testanything.org</a>?</p>
<p>But you know what? Why not execute execute locally first to check if that&#8217;s working&#8230; moreover, why not use <a title="Jenkins TAP Plug-in" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin">Jenkins TAP Plug-in</a> and see what happens?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what is necessary.
